    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma.
Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of
science is a contest with mistake, and must keep the
conscience alive.”—George Eliot (“Middlemarch,” Chap.
LXXIII.)</p>

      <div class='line'>3.—“<em>Research and reason</em>&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As indicated by Professor Oliver T. Lodge, “It is but
a platitude to say that our clear and conscious aim should
always be truth, and that no lower or meaner standard
should ever be allowed to obtrude itself before us. Our
ancestors fought hard and suffered much for the privilege of
free and open inquiry, for the right of conducting investigation
untrammelled by prejudice and foregone conclusions,
and they were ready to examine into any phenomenon which
presented itself.... Fear of avowing interest or of
examining into unorthodox facts is, I venture to say, not
in accordance with the highest traditions of the scientific
attitude.”—(Address as President of the Mathematical and
Physical Section of the British Association, 1891.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>See also the words of Richard Jefferies:—“Research
proceeds upon the same old lines and runs in the ancient
grooves.... But there should be no limit placed on
the mind.... Most injurious of all is the continuous
circling on the same path, and it is from this that I wish
to free my mind.”—(“The Story of My Heart,” Chap. X.)</p>

human faces. Like human Maharajas, they have their tragedies

monkey chieftain, weak and limping, having evidently been
worsted in a severe fight with another of his own kind. One
hand hung powerless, his face and eyes bore terrible traces of
battle, and he hirpled slowly along with a pathetic air of suffering,
supporting himself on the shoulder of a female, a wife, the
only member of his clan who had remained faithful to him
after his defeat. We threw them bread and raisins, and the
wounded warrior carefully stowed the greater part away in his
cheek pouch. The faithful wife, seeing her opportunity, sprang
on him, holding fast his one sound hand, and, opening his
mouth, she deftly scooped out the store of raisins. Then she
sat and ate them very calmly at a safe distance, while he
mowed and chattered in impotent rage. He knew that without
her help he could not reach home, and was fain to wait with
what patience he might till the raisins were finished. It was a
sad sight, but, like more sad sights, touched with the light of
comedy. This was probably her first chance of disobedience
or of self-assertion in her whole life, and I am afraid she
thoroughly enjoyed it. Then she led him away.”—J. Lockwood

<p class='c011'>“Other implements of Palæolithic age are formed of
bone and horn. Among these are harpoon-heads, barbed
on one or both sides, awls, pins, and needles with well-formed
eyes. But by far the most noteworthy objects of
this class are the fragments of bone, horn, ivory, and stone,
which exhibit outlined and even shaded sketches of various
animals. These engravings have been made with a sharp-pointed
implement, and are often wonderfully characteristic
representations of the creatures they pourtray. The figures
are sometimes single, in other cases they are drawn in
groups. We find representations of a fish, a seal, an ibex,
the red-deer, the great Irish elk or deer, the bison, the
horse, the cave-bear, the reindeer, and the mammoth or
woolly elephant. Besides engravings, we meet also with
sculptures.... It is impossible to say to what use all
these objects were put. Some of them may have been
handles for knives, while others are mere fragments, and
only vague guesses can be made as to the nature of the
original implements. It is highly probable, however, that
many of these works of art may have been designed simply
as such, for the pleasure and amusement of the draughtsman
and his fellows.”—James Geikie (“Prehistoric Europe,”
Chap. II.).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... The culture or appreciation of Art is of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>itself evidence of a higher nature in man; “a soul, a
psyche, a something which aspires,” as Richard Jefferies
calls it. For though the professional pursuit of Art may be
occasionally not unmingled with mercenary motives, or with
the pourtrayal of incentives to lower desire, yet the ultimate
appeal of every truly beautiful picture or object of Art
is, at any rate, not to man’s mercenary or meaner nature.

persons who are impure. The soul is the higher even by
gazing on beauty.”—(“The Story of My Heart,” Chap. VII.)</p>

upon all manner of subjects, acquired, by degrees, a knowledge

only educated women.”—(“History of Marriage,” p. 81.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Hetairai</em>, famous at once for their beauty and intellect

were objects of universal admiration among the most
distinguished Greeks. They were admitted to their assemblies
and banquets, while the ‘honest’ women of Greece were,
without exception, confined to the house.... A considerable
number of women preferred the greater freedom
which they enjoyed <em>as Hetairai</em> to marriage, and carried on
the trade of prostitution as a means of livelihood. In unrestrained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>intercourse with men, the more intelligent of the
<em>Hetairai</em>, who were doubtless often of good birth, acquired
a far greater degree of versatility and culture than that
possessed by the majority of married women, living in a
state of enforced ignorance and bondage. This invested
the <em>Hetairai</em> with a greater charm for the men, in addition
to the arts which they employed in the special exercise of
their profession. This explains the fact that many of them
enjoyed the esteem of some of the most distinguished and
eminent men of Greece, to whom they stood in a relationship
of influential intimacy, a position held by no legitimate
wife. The names of these <em>Hetairai</em> are famous to the

      <div class='line'>8.—“<em>The waste of woman worth</em>&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Since these words were written, a letter from Mrs. Mona
Caird has been published by the “Women’s Emancipation
Union,” in which is said:—“So far from giving
safety and balance to the ‘natural forces,’ these time-honoured
restrictions, springing from a narrow theory
which took its rise in a pre-scientific age, are fraught with
the gravest dangers, creating a perpetual struggle and
unrest, filling society with the perturbations and morbid
developments of powers that ought to be spending themselves
freely and healthfully on their natural objects. Anyone
who has looked a little below the surface of women’s
lives can testify to the general unrest and nervous exhaustion
or <em>malaise</em> among them, although each would
probably refer her suffering to some cause peculiar to herself
and her circumstances, never dreaming that she was
the victim of an evil that gnaws at the very heart of society,
making of almost every woman the heroine of a silent
tragedy. I think few keen observers will deny that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>almost always the women of placid temperament, with very
little sensibility, who are happy and contented; those of
more highly wrought nervous systems and imaginative
faculty, who are nevertheless capable of far greater joy than
their calmer sisters, in nine cases out of ten are secretly
intensely miserable. And the cause of this is not eternal and
unalterable. The nervously organised being is <em>not</em> created
to be miserable; but when intense vital energy is thwarted
and misdirected—so long as the energy lasts—there must
be intense suffering.... It is only when resignation
sets in, when the ruling order convinces at last and
tires out the rebel nerves and the keen intelligence, that we
know that the living forces are defeated, and that death has
come to quiet the suffering. All this is waste of human
force, and far worse than waste.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Alexandre Dumas fils says:—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Celles-là
voient, de jour en jour, en sondant l’horizon toujours le
même, s’effeuiller dans l’isolement, dans l’inaction, dans
l’impuissance, les facultés divines qui leur avaient d’abord
fait faire de si beaux rêves et dont il leur semble que
l’expansion eût pu être matériellement et moralement si
profitable aux autres et à elles-memes.”—(“Les Femmes
qui Tuent et les Femmes qui Votent,” p. 107).</span></p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... And Lady Florence Dixie has written:—“Nature
gives strength and beauty to man, and Nature
gives strength and beauty to woman. In this latter instance
man flies in the face of Nature, and declares that she must
be artificially restrained. Woman must not be allowed to
grow up strong like man, because if she did the fact would
establish her equality with him, and this cannot be tolerated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>So the boy and man are allowed freedom of body, and are
trained up to become muscular and strong, while the woman,
by artificial, not natural, laws, is bidden to remain inactive
and passive, and, in consequence, weak and undeveloped.
Mentally it is the same. Nature has unmistakably given
to woman a greater amount of brain power. This is at once
perceivable in childhood. For instance, on the stage, girls
are always employed in preference to boys, for they are considered
brighter and sharper in intellect and brain power.
Yet man deliberately sets himself to stunt that early evidence
of mental capacity by laying down the law that woman’s
education shall be on a lower level than that of man’s; that
natural truths, which all women should early learn, should be
hidden from her; and that while men may be taught everything,
women must only acquire a narrow and imperfect
knowledge both of life and of Nature’s laws. I maintain
that this procedure is arbitrary and cruel, and false to
Nature. I characterise it by the strong word of infamous.
It has been the means of sending to their graves, unknown,
unknelled, and unnamed, thousands of women whose high
intellects have been wasted, and whose powers for good
have been paralysed and undeveloped.”—(“Gloriana: or,
the Revolution of 1900,” p. 130.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Buckle gives numerous instances which support
the foregoing assertions, saying himself on the point:—“That
women are more deductive than men, because they
think quicker than men, is a proposition which some persons
will not relish, and yet it may be proved in a variety of
ways. Indeed, nothing could prevent its being universally
admitted except the fact that the remarkable rapidity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>which women think is obscured by that miserable, that contemptible,
that preposterous system called their education,
in which valuable things are carefully kept from them, and
trifling things carefully taught to them, until their fine
and nimble minds are irreparably injured.”—(“Miscellaneous
Works,” Vol. I., p. 8, “On the influence of Women
on the Progress of Knowledge.”)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... As a man of straightforward common-sense,
Sydney Smith has left a name unsurpassed in our literary
history. Here is something of what he says on this question
of woman’s intellect and its waste:—“As the matter stands
at present, half the talent in the universe runs to waste, and
is totally unprofitable. It would have been almost as well
for the world, hitherto, that women, instead of possessing
the capacities they do at present, should have been born
wholly destitute of wit, genius, and every other attribute of
mind of which men make so eminent a use; and the ideas
of use and possession are so united together that, because
it has been the custom in almost all countries to give to
women a different and worse education than to men, the
notion has obtained that they do not possess faculties which
they do not cultivate.”—(“Essay on Female Education.”)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Hear also John Ruskin on the relative intellect
or capacity of women:—“Let us try, then, whether we
cannot get at some clear and harmonious idea (and it must
be harmonious if it is true) of what womanly mind and
virtue are in power and office, with respect to man’s; and
how their relations, rightly accepted, aid and increase the
vigour, and honour, and authority of both.... Let us
see whether the greatest, the wisest, the purest-hearted of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>all ages are agreed in anywise on this point.... And
first let us take Shakespeare;&#160;... there is hardly a play
that has not a perfect woman in it, steadfast in grave hope
and errorless purpose.... Such, in broad light, is Shakespeare’s
testimony to the position and character of women
in human life. He represents them as infallibly faithful
and wise counsellors, incorruptibly just and pure examples,
strong always to sanctify, even when they cannot save....
I ask you next to receive the witness of Walter
Scott.... So that, in all cases, with Scott as with
Shakespeare, it is the woman who watches over, teaches,
and guides the youth; it is never, by any chance, the youth
who watches over or educates his mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I could multiply witness upon witness of this kind
upon you, if I had time. Nay, I could go back into the
mythical teaching of the most ancient times, and show you
how the great people, how that great Egyptian people,
wisest then of nations, gave to their Spirit of Wisdom the
form of a woman; and into her hand, for a symbol, the
weaver’s shuttle; and how the name and form of that spirit
adopted, believed, and obeyed by the Greeks, became that
Athena of the olive-helm and cloudy shield, to whose faith
you owe, down to this date, whatever you hold most
precious in art, in literature, or in types of national virtue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I will not wander into this distant and mythical
element; I will only ask you to give the legitimate value to
the testimony of these great poets and men of the world,
consistent as you see it is on this head. I will ask you
whether it can be supposed that these men, in the main work
of their lives, are amusing themselves with a fictitious and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>idle view of the relations between man and woman; nay,
worse than fictitious or idle, for a thing may be imaginary
yet desirable, if it were possible; but this, their ideal of
women, is, according to our common idea of the marriage
relation, wholly undesirable. The woman, we say, is not to
guide nor even to think for herself. The man is always to
be the wiser; he is to be the thinker, the ruler, the superior
in knowledge and discretion, as in power. Is it not somewhat
important to make up our minds on this matter? Are
Shakespeare and Æschylus, Dante and Homer merely dressing
dolls for us; or, worse than dolls, unnatural visions,
the realisation of which, were it possible, would bring
anarchy into all households, and ruin into all affections?
Are all these great men mistaken, or, are we?”—(“Sesame
and Lilies,” p. 125, <em>et seq.</em>)</p>

<p class='c011'>Truly, in the face of these things, Tennyson had reason
concerning his fellow men, when he wrote:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Between the most cultured <em>hetairai</em> and the poor outcast
as here shown, were many intervening or coalescing grades.
Instance, as one of the phases, the following sketch of an
Indian courtesan:—“Lalun is a member of the most
ancient profession in the world. Lilith was her very-great-grandmama,
and that was before the days of Eve,
as everyone knows. In the West, people say rude things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>about Lalun’s profession, and write lectures about it, and
distribute the lectures to young people, in order that
morality may be preserved. In the East, where the profession
is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter,
nobody writes lectures or takes any notice.”—Rudyard
Kipling (“On the City Wall”).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>—“... <em>worse than brutal woes</em>&#160;...”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dumas fils, who knew well whereof he wrote, tells of
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les femmes du peuple et de la campagne, suant du
matin au soir pour gagner le pain quotidien, le dos courbé,
domptées par la misère:</span>” of whom some of the daughters
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“sortent du groupe par le chemin tentant et facile de la
prostitution, mais où le labeur est encore plus rude.”—(“Les
Femmes qui Tuent et les Femmes qui Votent,” p. 101.)</span>
As historical instance of depth of wretched degradation,
<em>conf.</em> mediæval privilege of “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scortum ante mortem</span></i>,” conceded
to some of even the vilest and lowest of criminals
condemned to capital punishment. Though such a condition
is barely more than parallel to the pitch of infamy
of modern times, as instanced in a quotation reproduced by
John Ruskin, in “Sesame and Lilies,” p. 91, first ed.:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The salons of Mme. C., who did the honours with clever
imitative grace and elegance, were crowded with princes,
dukes, marquises, and counts, in fact, with the same <em>male</em> company
as one meets at the parties of the Princess Metternich and
Madame Drouyn de Lhuys. Some English peers and members
of Parliament were present, and appeared to enjoy the animated
and dazzlingly improper scene. On the second floor the supper-tables
were loaded with every delicacy of the season. That
your readers may form some idea of the dainty fare of the
Parisian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-monde</span></i>, I copy the <em>menu</em> of the supper which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>served to all the guests (about 200) seated, at four o’clock.
Choice Yquem, Johannisberg, Lafitte, Tokay, and Champagne
of the finest vintages were served most lavishly throughout the
morning. After supper dancing was resumed with increased
animation, and the ball terminated with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chaine diabolique</span></i> and
a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cancan d’enfer</span></i> at seven in the morning.”—(<cite>Morning Post</cite>,
March 10th, 1865.)</p>

<p class='c011'>To which perhaps the most fitting comment is certain
words of Letourneau’s:—“It is important to make a distinction.
The resemblance between the moral coarseness
of the savage and the depravation of the civilised
man is quite superficial.... The brutality of the savage
has nothing in common with the moral retrogression of the
civilised man, struck with decay.... The posterity of
the savage may, with the aid of time and culture, attain to
great moral elevation, for there are vital forces within him
which are fresh and intact. The primitive man is still young,
and he possesses many latent energies susceptible of
development. In short, the savage is a child, while the
civilised man, whose moral nature is corrupt, presents to us
rather the picture of decrepit old age.”—(“Evolution of
Marriage,” Chap. V.)</p>

<p class='c011'>If M. Letourneau will apply his strictures as to senility
and decay to so-called “Society” and its system, rather
than to the individual, he will find many thinkers, both
of his own and other nationalities, agree with his conclusion.
Yet not death, but reform, is the righter event
to indicate. And by what means that reform may be ensured
is, at least in part, clearly set forth in the following
passage from a paper recently published by the Women’s
Printing Society:—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“My positive belief is that women, and women alone, will
be able to reverse the world’s verdict, but they must change
their method of reform in two important matters.</p>

<p class='c004'>“First and foremost, every mother must teach her daughters
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about the
relations of the sexes, the condition of social opinion, the historical,
physiological, ethical aspects of the question. She must
train herself so as to be able to teach the young minds these
solemn, serious aspects of life, in such a way that the world may
learn that the innocence of ignorance is inferior to the purity of
right-minded, fearless knowledge. She must strengthen the
minds and form the judgment of her daughters, so that they
may demand reciprocal purity in those whom they would espouse.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fully understand the difficulty of teaching our pure-minded,
delicately-nurtured daughters the terrible lessons of this seamy
side of life. I am a mother of daughters myself, and I know
the cost at which the courage has to be obtained, but in this
matter each mother must help another. What a mighty force
is influence! What help is conveyed by pressure of opinion!
How often do I remember with gratitude the words which I
once read as quoted of Mrs. John Stuart Mill, who taught her
little daughter to have the courage to hear what other little girls
had to bear. How gladly I acknowledge the stimulus of that
example to myself, and therefore I would urge all women to
SPEAK OUT. Do not be afraid. You will not lose your
womanliness. You will not lose your purity. You will not
have your sensibilities blunted by such rough use. No, “To
the pure all things are pure.” We must reach the mass
through the unit, it is the individual who helps to move the
world.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We must teach and train the mind of every woman with
whom we come in contact, for we have mighty work to do. A
no less deed than to reverse the judgment of the whole world
on the subject of purity. I do not believe it is possible for men
to accomplish any radical reform in this matter. It belongs to
women—I was going to say exclusively—but I will modify my
assertion; and if women do not speak out more courageously
in the future than they have done in the past, I believe there is
but slight chance of any further amelioration in the condition of
society than those which are such an inadequate return at the
present time, for all the love and money expended on them.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>And the same writer says, on a still more recent occasion:
“I find no words strong enough to denounce the sin of
silence amongst women on these social evils; and I have
come to feel that the best proof of the subjection and
degradation of my sex lies in the opinions often expressed
by so-called Christian and pure women <em>about other women</em>.
If their judgments were not perverted, if their wills were not
broken, if their consciences were not asleep, and if their
souls were not enslaved, they would not, they could not,
hold their peace and let the havoc go on with women and
children as it does.”—Mrs. Laura E. Morgan-Browne
(“<cite>Woman’s Herald</cite>”, 27th Feb., 1892).</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Morgan-Browne is, perhaps, not more than needfully
severe on the almost criminal reticence of women; yet man
must certainly take the greater share of blame for the social
“double morality” which condemns irrevocably a woman,
and leaves practically unscathed a man, for the same act.
It is male-made laws and rules that have resulted in the
perverted judgments, broken wills, sleeping consciences,
and enslaved souls, which both sexes may deplore. Charles
Kingsley pointed a cogent truth when he said that “Women
will never obtain moral equity until they have civil equality.”

<p class='c011'>“In all barbarous societies the subjection of woman is
more or less severe; customs or coarse laws have regulated
the savagery of the first anarchic ages; they have doubtless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>set up a barrier against primitive ferocity, they have interdicted
certain absolutely terrible abuses of force, but they
have only replaced these by a servitude which is still very
heavy, is often iniquitous, and no longer permits to legally-possessed
women those escapes, or capriciously accorded
liberties, which were tolerated in savage life.”—Letourneau

      <div class='line'>4.—“<em>Crippled and crushed by cruelty and toil</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Some of this crippling has been of set purpose, as well as
the simple result of brutal male recklessness. Instance the
distortion of the feet of high-born female children in China,
the tradition concerning which is that the practice was
initiated and enjoined by an emperor of old, one of whose
wives had (literally) “run away” from him. A somewhat
similar precaution would seem to be indicated as a very
probable source of the persistent and almost universal incommodity
and incumbrance of the dress of woman as compared
with that of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Thomas Inman, in his “Ancient Faiths Embodied in
Ancient Names,” Vol. I., p. 53, seems to indicate a different,
yet closely allied, origin and motive for the impeding form
of woman’s clothing, the subordinate status of woman being
always the purpose in view.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “Even supposing a woman to give no encouragement
to her admirers, many plots are always laid to
carry her off. In the encounters which result from these,
she is almost certain to receive some violent injury, for
each of the combatants orders her to follow him, and, in
the event of her refusing, throws a spear at her. The early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>life of a young woman at all celebrated for beauty is
generally one continued series of captivities to different
masters, of ghastly wounds, of wandering in strange families,
of rapid flights, of bad treatment from other females amongst
whom she is brought, a stranger, by her captor; and rarely
do you see a form of unusual grace and elegance but it is
marked and scarred by the furrows of old wounds; and
many a female thus wanders several hundred miles from
the home of her infancy, being carried off successively to
distant and more distant points.”—Sir George Grey

chiefly in greater tenderness and less selfishness, and this
holds good even with savages, as shown by a well-known
passage in “Mungo Park’s Travels,” and by statements
made by other travellers. Woman, owing to her maternal
instincts, displays these qualities towards her infants in an
eminent degree; therefore it is likely that she should often
extend them towards her fellow creatures.”... “Mungo
Park heard the negro women teaching their young children
to love the truth.”—Darwin (“The Descent of Man,”

could have done. The masculine spirit, enslaved and imprisoned,
becomes diabolic or broken; the feminine, only
warped, weakened, or distorted, is ready, whenever the
pressure upon it is removed, to assume its true attitude.”—(“Woman

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Perhaps as appositely here, as elsewhere, may
be recorded the following:—“An American writer says: ‘While
I lived among the Choctaw Indians, I held a consultation
with one of their chiefs respecting the successive
stages of their progress in the arts of civilised life, and,
among other things, he informed me that at their start they
made a great mistake, they only sent boys to school.
Their boys came home intelligent men, but they married
uneducated and uncivilised wives, and the uniform result
was that the children were all like their mothers. The
father soon lost all his interest both in wife and children.
And now,’ said he, ‘if we could educate but one class
of our children, we should choose the girls, for, when they
become mothers, they educate their sons.’ This is the
point, and it is true.”—(<cite>Manchester Examiner and Times</cite>,

was free to kill the infant, which was done by applying
a piece of wet stuff to the mouth and nose, or to let

for the whole of her life. If the union was sterile, or
the children put to death, the man had always the right to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>abandon the woman when and how it seemed good to him.”—Letourneau

custom. But one day, during his absence, a daughter was
born to him, whom the mother secretly sent to a relative to
save her, and then declared to her husband that she had
been delivered of a still-born child.—(R. Smith, on “Kinship,”
p. 282; quoted by Letourneau, “Evolution of

husband is to the wife a brutal master to a laborious
slave. Was a more horrid deed ever perpetrated than that
witnessed on the west coast by Byron, who saw a wretched

husband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping
a basket of sea-eggs!”—(“Voyage of the <cite>Beagle</cite>,” Chap. X.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Mrs. Reichardt tells of a certain Moslem, of
high standing in the society of Damascus, who “married a
young girl of ten, and, after she had born him two sons, he
drove her almost mad with such cruelty and unkindness
that she escaped, and went back to her father. Her
husband sent for her to return, and, as she was hidden out
of his sight, he wrung the necks of both his sons, and sent
their bodies to his wife to show her what he had in store for
her. The young mother, not yet twenty, died in a few
days.”—(See <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, June, 1891.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... It will not be forgotten that, in more than one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of the older civilisations, the father had the power of life and
death over the members of the family, even past adult age.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, to come to quite recent times, and this our England,
Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy, to whose unflagging
energy, during some fifteen years of labour, was mainly
attributable (as the Parliamentary sponsors of the measures
know) the amelioration in the English law concerning wives
and mothers, embodied in the Married Women’s Property
Acts of 1870 and 1882, together with the later and beneficent
Guardianship of Infants Act, 1886, relates, in her
record of the history of this latter Act:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be remembered that so recently as 1883, a young
lady petitioned that she might be allowed to spend her summer
holidays with her own mother, from whom she was separated
for no fault of her own or of her mother’s, but in virtue of the
supreme legal rights of her father. The Court refused her
petition, natural and proper as it seems to everyone of human
feelings; and the words of the Master of the Rolls in giving
judgment, on the 24th of July, 1883, are more significant and
instructive as to the actual state of the law than the words of
any non-professional writer can be:—‘The law of England
<em>recognises the rights of the father</em>, not as the guardian, but
<em>because he is the father of his children</em>.... <em>The rights of
the father are recognised because he is the father</em>; his duties as
a father are recognised because they are natural duties. The
natural duties of a father are to treat his children with the
utmost affection, and with infinite tenderness.... The law
recognises these duties, from which if a father breaks he breaks
from everything which nature calls upon him to do; and,
although the law may not be able to insist upon their performance,
it is because the law recognises them, and knows that in
almost every case the natural feelings of a father will prevail.
The law trusts that the father will perform his natural duties,
and does not, and, indeed, cannot, inquire how they have been
performed.... I am not prepared to say whether <em>when
the child is a ward of Court, and the conduct of the father is
such as to exhaust all patience—such, for instance, as cruelty, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>pitiless spitefulness carried to a great extent—the Court might
not interfere. But such interference will be exercised</em> <span class='fss'>ONLY IN
THE UTMOST NEED, AND IN MOST EXTREME CASES</span>. It is
impossible to lay down the rule of the Court more clearly than
has been done by Vice-Chancellor Bacon in the recent case of
“<em>Re.</em> Plowley” (47 “L.T.,” N.S., 283). In saying that this
Court, “whatever be its authority or jurisdiction, <em>has no
authority to interfere with the sacred right of a father over his
own children</em>,” the learned Vice-Chancellor has summed up all
that I intended to say. <em>The rights of a father are sacred rights,
because his duties are sacred.</em>...’</p>

<p class='c004'>“These sacred rights of the father were, it will be observed,
in the eyes of the law so <em>exclusive</em> and paramount as to justify
and demand the refusal to a young girl, at the most critical
period of early womanhood, of the solace of a few weeks’ intercourse
with a blameless and beloved mother; and this although
the gratification of the daughter’s wish would have involved no
denial to the father of the solace of his daughter’s company, since
she was not actually, but only <em>legally</em>, in his custody, not having
seen him for more than a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will be seen from this that the father alone has the absolute
legal right to deal with his child or children, to the extent
of separating them, at his own sole pleasure, from their mother,
and of giving them into the care and custody of any person
whom he may think fit. The mother has, as such, no legal
status, no choice, voice, lot, or part in the matter.”—Mrs.
Wolstenholme Elmy (“The Infants’ Act, 1886,” p. 2).</p>

<p class='c011'>It is consolatory to learn that a palliation of some part of
the above unjust conditions has been achieved; yet how
often has our presumedly happy land witnessed scenes of
child misery and helpless mother-love, to which was
denied even the poor consolation, so pathetically depicted
by Mrs. Browning, in a scene which, as Moir truly says,
“weighs on the heart like a nightmare”;—</p>

<p class='c011'>First written “disproportioned basis,” but altered, with

which can co-exist with the production and nursing
of the due (!) number of healthy children.”—(“Study of
Sociology,” Chap. XV., note 5.)</p>

<p class='c011'>But Professor Huxley speaks, more humanly, of “...
such a peasant woman as one sees in the Alps, striding ever
upward, heavily burdened, and with mind bent only on her
home; but yet, without effort and without thought, knitting
for her children. Now stockings are good and comfortable
things, and the children will undoubtedly be much the
better for them, but surely it would be short-sighted, to say
the least of it, to depreciate this toiling mother as a mere
stocking-machine—a mere provider of physical comforts.”—(“On
Improving Natural Knowledge.”)</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, if it be—as truly it is—a senseless and disgraceful
depreciation of woman to look upon her as “a mere
machine for the making of stockings,” is it not equally
unworthy and unwise to consider her as—primarily and

<p class='c011'>In even so sedate and usually dispassionate a physiologist
and philosopher as Charles Darwin, the masculine sex-bias
is so ingrained and so ingenuous that he strives to disparage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and contemn the notorious mental quickness or intuition
of woman by saying:—“It is generally admitted
that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception,
and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked
than in man; but some, at least, of these faculties are
characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a past
and lower state of civilisation.”—(“The Descent of Man,”
Chap. XIX.).</p>

<p class='c011'>His unconscious sex-bias apparently overlooked the pregnant
and very pertinent caution which he had himself
uttered in a previous work:—“Useful organs, however
little they may be developed, unless we have reason to
suppose that they were formerly more highly developed,
ought not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be
in a nascent condition, and in progress towards further
development. Rudimentary organs, on the other hand,
are either quite useless, such as teeth which never cut
through the gums, or, almost useless, such as the wings of
an ostrich, which serve merely as sails.... It is, however,
often difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and
nascent organs, for we can judge only by analogy whether a
part is capable of further development, in which case alone
it deserves to be called nascent.”—(“Origin of Species,”
Chap. XIV.).</p>

<p class='c011'>But surely Darwin would admit that experiment in
capacity of education and development was as worthy
evidence as “analogy,” and would further acknowledge how
little effort in this direction had ever been made with
woman. Buckle would seem to be far nearer the truth in
ascribing to woman an unconscious deductive form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>reasoning, as against the slow and studied inductive process
to which man is so generally trained to be a slave.—(See
Buckle’s Essay on the “Influence of Women on the Progress
of Knowledge,” as quoted from in Note XIII., 8.)</p>

being the prince of husbands, he was lenient to my desires,
and yielded the point.”—(“Life of Robert Browning,” by

<p class='c011'>The <span class='sc'>Status of Woman</span>, according to the <span class='sc'>Chinese</span>
Classics:—</p>

<p class='c011'>In a periodical published in Shanghai, Dr. Faber, a well-known
scholar, writes (1891) a paper on the status of
women in China. He refers especially to the theoretical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>position assigned to women by the Chinese Classics.
These lay down the different dogmas on the subject:</p>

<p class='c014'>“1.—Women are as different in nature from man as
earth is from heaven.</p>

<p class='c014'>“2.—Dualism, not only in body form, but in the very
essence of nature, is indicated and proclaimed by
Chinese moralists of all times and creed. The
male belongs to <em>yang</em>, the female to <em>yin</em>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“3.—Death and all other evils have their origin in the
<em>yin</em>, or female principle; life and prosperity come
from its subjection to the <em>yang</em> or male principle;
and it is therefore regarded as a law of nature
that women should be kept under the control of
men, and not be allowed any will of their own.</p>

<p class='c014'>“4.—Women, indeed, are human beings, (!) but they
are of a lower state than men, and can never
attain to full equality with them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“5.—The aim of female education, therefore, is perfect
submission, not cultivation and development of
mind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“6.—Women cannot have any happiness of their own;
they have to live and work for men.</p>

<p class='c014'>“7.—Only as the mother of a son, as the continuator of
the direct line of a family, can a woman escape
from her degradation and become to a certain
degree her husband’s equal; but then only in
household affairs, especially the female department,
and in the ancestral hall.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“8.—In the other world, woman’s condition remains
exactly the same, for the same laws of existence
apply. She is not the equal of her husband; she
belongs to him, and is dependent for her happiness
on the sacrifice offered by her descendants.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are the doctrines taught by Confucius, Mencius,
and the ancient sages, whose memory has been revered in
China for thousands of years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, what wonder that Chinese civilisation and progress
is, and remains, fossilised, inert, dead?</p>

<h4 class='c007'><span class='sc'>Japan.</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>“There is one supreme maxim upon which the conduct
of a well-bred woman is made to turn, and this is ‘obedience.’
Life, the Japanese girl is taught, divides itself into
three stages of obedience. In youth she is to obey her
father; in marriage her husband; in widowhood her eldest
son. Hence her preparation for life is always preparation
for service. The marriage of the Japanese girl usually
takes place when she is about seventeen. It is contrary
to all custom that she should have any voice in it.
Once married, she passes from her father’s household into
the household of her husband, and her period of self-abnegation
begins. Her own family is to be as nothing to her.
Her duty is to charm the existence of her husband, and to
please his relations. Custom demands that she shall
always smile upon him, and that she shall carefully hide
from him any signs of bad humour, jealousy, or physical
pain.”—Tinseau (quoted in <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, Vol.
IV., p. 282.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Note well the last two words of the above quotation;
they have a bearing on much that will have to be said
presently. Meanwhile, we read from another writer: “The
expression, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res angusta domi</span></i>, might have been invented for
Japan, so narrow of necessity is the wife’s home life. The
husband mixes with the world, the wife does not; the
husband has been somewhat inspired, and his thoughts
widened by his intercourse with foreigners, the wife has not
met them. The husband has more or less acquaintance
with western learning; the wife has none. Affection
between the two, within the limits which unequal intellectuality
ruthlessly prescribes, there well may be, but the
love which comes of a perfect intimacy, of mutual knowledge
and common aspiration, there can rarely be. The
very vocabulary of romantic love does not exist in
Japanese; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i>, there is little of the fact.” Yet, under
the influence of western civilisation, these things are
changing rapidly, and Mr. Norman, the commissioner of
the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, further relates that “The generation
that is now growing up will be very different. Not only
will the men of it be more western, but the women also.
As girls they will have been to schools like our schools at
home, and they will have learned English, and history, and
geography, and science, and foreign music; perhaps, even,
something of politics and political economy. They will
know something of ‘society,’ as we now use the term, and
will both seek it and make it. The old home life will
become unbearable to the woman, and she will demand the
right of choosing her husband just as much as he chooses
her. Then the rest will be easy.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The harsh and restrained position, both of Japanese and
Chinese women, is frequently attributed to Confucianism;
yet the matter does not seem to be of any one creed, but
rather of every religious creed. Thus Mrs. Reichardt tells
us, concerning Mahommedan women and Mahommedan
married life, that—</p>

<p class='c011'>“A Mahommedan girl is brought up with the idea that
she has nothing to do with love. It is <em>ayib</em> (shame) for
her to love her husband. She dare not do it if she would.
What he asks and expects of her is to tremble before him,
and yield him unquestioning obedience. I have <em>seen</em> a
husband look pleased and complacent when his wife
looked afraid to lift up her eyes, even when visitors were
present.”—(<cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, June, 1891.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor is Confucius alone, or the simple contagion of his
teaching, rightly to be blamed for the following condition
of things in our own dependency of</p>

<h4 class='c007'><span class='sc'>India.</span></h4>

<p class='c015'>The <cite>Bombay Guardian</cite> calls attention to an extraordinary
book which is being circulated (early in 1891)
broadcast, as a prize-book in the Government Girls’ School
in the Bombay Presidency. The following quotations are
given as specimens of the teachings set forth in the
book:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the husband of a virtuous woman be ugly, of good
or bad disposition, diseased, fiendish, irascible, or a
drunkard, old, stupid, dumb, blind, deaf, hot-tempered,
poor, extremely covetous, a slanderer, cowardly, perfidious,
and immoral, nevertheless she ought to worship him as
God, with mind, speech, and person.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“The wife who gives an angry answer to her husband
will become a village pariah dog; she will also become a
jackal, and live in an uninhabited desert.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The woman who eats sweetmeats without sharing them
with her husband will become a hen-owl, living in a
hollow tree.—(Conf. Note VI., 8.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“The woman who walks alone without her husband will
become a filth-eating village sow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The woman who speaks disrespectfully to her husband
will be dumb in the next incarnation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The woman who hates her husband’s relations will
become from birth to birth a musk-rat, living in filth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She who is always jealous of her husband’s concubine
will be childless in the next incarnation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To illustrate the blessed result of a wife’s subserviency, a
story is told of “the great reward that came to the wife of
an ill-tempered, diseased, and wicked Brahmin, who served
her husband with a slavish obedience, and even went the
length of carrying him on her own shoulders to visit his
mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So quotes the <cite>Woman’s Journal</cite> of Boston, Mass., and
says in comment thereon:—“The British Government in
India has bound itself not to interfere with the religion of
the natives, but it certainly ought not to inculcate in
Government schools the worst doctrines of heathenism.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, again, are these Hindoo, or Japanese, or Chinese
doctrines simply the precepts of “heathenism” alone?
Buckle quotes for us the following passage from the
Nonconformist “Fergusson on the Epistles,” 1656, p.
242:—“There is not any husband to whom this honour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of submission is not due. No personal infirmity, frowardness
of nature, no, not even on the point of religion, doth
deprive him of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Much the same teaching is continued a century later in
the noted Dr. Gregory’s “A Father’s Legacy to his
Daughters”; and again, hideously true is the picture which
Mill has to draw, in 1869:—“Above all, a female
slave has (in Christian countries) an admitted right, and
is considered under a moral obligation to refuse to her
master the last familiarity. Not so the wife; however
brutal a tyrant she may unfortunately be chained to,
though she may know that he hates her, though it may
be his daily pleasure to torture her, and though she may
feel it impossible not to loathe him, he can claim from her
and enforce the lowest degradation of a human being, that
of being made the instrument of an animal function contrary
to her inclinations.... No amount of ill-usage,
without adultery superadded, will in England free a wife
from her tormentor.”—(“The Subjection of Women,” pp.
57, 59.)</p>

<p class='c011'>As to how far public feeling, if not law, has amended
some of these conditions, see Note XXXVI., 6. Meanwhile,
as an evidence of what is the “orthodox” opinion
and sentiment at this present day, it may be noted that
Cardinal Manning wrote in the <cite>Dublin Review</cite>, July, 1891:—“A
woman enters for life into a sacred contract with a
man before God at the altar to fulfil to him the duties of
wife, mother, and head of his home. Is it lawful for her,
even with his consent, to make afterwards a second contract
for so many shillings a week with a millowner whereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>she becomes unable to provide her husband’s food, train up
her children, or do the duties of her home? It is no
question of the lawfulness of gaining a few more shillings
for the expenses of a family, but of the lawfulness of breaking
a prior contract, the most solemn between man and
woman. No arguments of expediency can be admitted.
It is an obligation of conscience to which all things must
give way. The duties of home must first be done” (by the
woman) “then other questions may be entertained.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Are not these English injunctions to womanly and wifely
slavery as trenchant and merciless as any ascribed to so-called
“heathenism”? And is it not the fuller truth that
the spirit of the male teaching against woman is the same
all the world over, and no mere matter of creed—which is
nevertheless made the convenient vehicle for such teaching;
and that, in brief, the precepts of womanly and wifely servitude
are blind, brutal, and universal?</p>

his countrymen the benefit of his impressions of English
life and social conditions.</p>

need to complain, for he writes of them not only in a
kindly spirit, but even with enthusiasm for their healthy
looks, graceful figures, and good conduct. We need not
follow his description of the processes in which the women
of the colliery are employed, but we may say in passing that
Mr. Wakeman was astonished by the ‘wonderful quickness
of eye and movement’ shown by the ‘screeners,’ and by
the ‘superb physical development’ and agility of the
‘fillers.’ He had expected to find them ‘the most forlorn
creatures bearing the image of women,’ and he found them
strong, healthy, good-natured, and thoroughly respectable.
‘English roses glow from English cheeks. You cannot

home from work, and then the “pit-brow” lass is arrayed
as becomingly as any of her class in England, and in the

her out from among her companions, unless for her fine
colour, form, and a positively classic poise and grace of carriage
possessed by no other working women of England.

time to time in the public prints, as witness the following,
published generally in the English newspapers of 14th Oct.,
1891:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Not long since a well-known European courier, having
grown grey in his occupation, fell ill, and like others similarly
afflicted, was compelled to call in a doctor. This gentleman
was completely taken by surprise on discovering that his patient
was a female. Then the sick woman—who had piloted numerous
English and American families through the land of the Latin,
the Turk, and others, and led timid tourists safely through
many imaginary dangers—confessed that she had worn men’s
clothes for forty years. She stated that her reasons for this
masquerade were that having, at the age of thirteen, been left a
friendless orphan, she had become convinced, after futile struggling
for employment, that many of the obstacles in her path
could be swept away by discarding her proper garments and
assuming the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> and attire of masculine youth. This she did.
She closely cut her hair, bought boy’s clothes, put them on, and
sallied forth in the world to seek her fortune. With the change
of dress seems to have come a change of luck, for she quickly
found employment, and being an apt scholar, and facile at
learning languages, was enabled after a time to obtain a
position as courier, and, but for her unfortunate illness, it is
tolerably certain that the truth would never have been revealed
during her lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In the early days of April, 1892, the Vienna correspondent
of the <cite>Standard</cite> reported that—</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“On the 30th ult., there died in Hungary, at about the same
hour, two ladies who served in 1848 in the Revolutionary Army,
and fought in several of the fiercest battles, dressed in military
uniform. One of them was several times promoted, and, under
the name of Karl, attained the rank of First Lieutenant of
Hussars. At this point, however, an artillery major stopped
her military career by marrying her. The other fought under
the name of Josef, and was decorated for valour in the field.
She married long after the campaign. A Hungarian paper,
referring to the two cases, says that about a dozen women
fought in 1848 in the insurrectionary ranks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Somewhat more detailed particulars concerning “Lieutenant
Karl” were afterwards given by the <cite>Manchester
Guardian</cite> (June 6, 1892), as follows:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Austrian <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkszeitung</span></cite> announces the death of Frau
Marie Hoche, who has had a most singular and romantic career.
Her maiden name was Lepstuk. In the momentous year of
1848 Marie Lepstuk, who was then eighteen years of age,
joined the German legion at Vienna; then, returning home, she
adopted the name of Karl and joined the Tyroler Jager Regiment
of the revolutionary army. She showed great bravery in
the battlefield, received the medallion, and was raised to the
rank of lieutenant. A wound compelled her to go into hospital,
but after her recovery she joined the Hussars. As a
reward for exceeding bravery she was next made oberlieutenant
on the field. Soon after this her sex was discovered, but a
major fell in love with her, and they were married. At Vilagos
both were taken prisoners, and while in the fortress she gave
birth to her first child. After the major’s death she was
remarried to Oberlieutenant Hoche. For the past few years
Frau Hoche has been in needy circumstances, but an appeal
from Jokai brought relief.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All of which goes far to discredit M. Michelet’s theory
that women are “born invalids,” an assertion which Dr.
Julia Mitchell “stigmatises naturally enough as ‘all nonsense,’”
and is thus approved—with a strange magnanimity—by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the <cite>British Medical Journal</cite>.—(See <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>,
April 29, 1892.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The “incapacity of women for military service” has been
of late days continually quoted as a bar to their right of
citizenship, as far as the Parliamentary Franchise is concerned.
In the face of the foregoing cases, and of the fact
that every mother risks her life in becoming a mother, while
very few men, indeed, risk theirs on the battlefield, it might
be thought that the fallacious argument would have perished
from shame and inanition long ago. But the inconsistencies
of partly-cultivated, masculine, one-sexed intellect are
as stubborn as blind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somewhat as to these ancient conditions may be gathered
from the position in India at the present day. Read the
following:—“The practice of early marriages by Hindoos I
was, of course, informed of by reading before coming to
India, but its mention in books was always coupled with
the assertion that in India girls reach puberty at a much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>earlier age than in cold climates. Judge, therefore, of my
surprise to find that so far from Hindoo girls being precocious
in physical development, they are much behind in
this respect; that a Hindoo girl of fifteen is about the
equal of an English child of eleven, instead of the reverse,
and that the statements made to the contrary by Englishmen
who have no opportunity of becoming acquainted with
Hindoo family life, were totally misleading. In the first
place they were under the impression that marriage never
takes place before puberty, and, secondly, they accepted the
Hindoo view as to what constitutes puberty. You know
that, unfortunately, they were misled as regards the first
point. I hope to show you that in the second place the
idea which they accepted as correct is a totally mistaken one.”—Mrs.
Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Address to the Hindoos of
Bombay on the subject of child-marriage; delivered at the
Hall of the Prarthana Somaj, Bombay, on the 11th Oct.,
1890).</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“As regards the marriage of girls before even what is
called puberty, I can hardly trust myself to speak, so
strongly are my feelings those of all Western—may I not
say of all civilised?—people in looking upon it as actually
criminal. Ah! gentlemen, those of you who are conversant
with such cases as I have seen, cases like those of Phulmoni
Dossee, which has just now stirred your hearts to insist
upon some change in the existing law, and others where
a life-long decrepitude has followed, to which death itself
were far preferable, do you not feel with me that penal servitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>is not too hard a punishment for such brutality? I
am glad to think that a very large section of Hindoo men
think with me. I have been repeatedly spoken to on the
subject, and members even of those castes which are most
guilty in this matter, have expressed to me a wish that
Government would interfere and put a stop to the practice.”—Mrs.
Pechey Phipson, M.D., <em>op. cit.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>A terrible evidence to the evil is borne by the following
document:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>[<span class='sc'>From “The Times of India,” November 8th, 1890.</span>]</div>
    <div class='c016'><em>To his Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>May it please Your Excellency.—The undersigned ladies,
practising medicine in India, respectfully crave your Excellency’s
attention to the following facts and considerations:—</p>

<p class='c004'>1. Your Excellency is aware that the present state of the
Indian law permits marriages to be consummated not only
before the wife is physically qualified for the duties of
maternity, but before she is able to perform the duties of
the conjugal relation, thus giving rise to numerous and great
evils.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. This marriage practice has become the cause of gross
immoralities and cruelties, which, owing to existing legislation,
come practically under the protection of the law. In some
cases the law has permitted homicide, and protected men,
who, under other circumstances, would have been criminally
punished.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. The institution of child-marriage rests upon public sentiment,
vitiated by degenerate religious customs and misinterpretation
of religious books. There are thousands among the
better educated classes who would rejoice if Government would
take the initiative, and make such a law as your memorialists
plead for, and in the end the masses would be grateful for
their deliverance from the galling yoke that has bound them
to poverty, superstition, and the slavery of custom for centuries.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>4. The present system of child-marriage, in addition to the
physical and moral effects which the Indian Governments have
deplored, produces sterility, and consequently becomes an
excuse for the introduction of other child-wives into the family,
thus becoming a justification for <em>polygamy</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. This system panders to sensuality, lowers the standard of
health and morals, degrades the race, and tends to perpetuate
itself and all its attendant evils to future generations.</p>

<p class='c004'>6. The lamentable case of the child-wife, Phulmani Dassi, of
Calcutta, which has excited the sympathy and the righteous
indignation of the Indian public, is only one of thousands of
cases that are continually happening, the final results being
quite as horrible, but sometimes less immediate. The following
instances have come under the personal observation of one or
another of your Excellency’s petitioners:—</p>

<p class='c017'>A. Aged 9. Day after marriage. Left <em>femur</em> dislocated,
<em>pelvis</em> crushed out of shape, flesh hanging in shreds.</p>

<p class='c017'>B. Aged 10. Unable to stand, bleeding profusely, flesh
much lacerated.</p>

<p class='c017'>C. Aged 9. So completely ravished as to be almost
beyond surgical repair. Her husband had two other
living wives, and spoke very fine English.</p>

<p class='c017'>D. Aged 10. A very small child, and entirely undeveloped
physically. This child was bleeding to death from the
<em>rectum</em>. Her husband was a man of about 40 years of
age, weighing not less than 11 stone. He had accomplished
his desire in an unnatural way.</p>

<p class='c017'>E. Aged about 9. Lower limbs completely paralysed.</p>

<p class='c017'>F. Aged about 12. Laceration of the <em>perineum</em> extending
through the <em>sphincter ani</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>G. Aged about 10. Very weak from loss of blood. Stated
that great violence had been done her in an unnatural
way.</p>

<p class='c017'>H. Aged about 12. Pregnant, delivered by <em>craniotomy</em>
with great difficulty, on account of the immature state of
the <em>pelvis</em> and maternal passage.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>I. Aged about 7. Living with husband. Died in great
agony after three days.</p>

<p class='c017'>K. Aged about 10. Condition most pitiable. After one day
in hospital was demanded by her husband for his “lawful”
use, he said.</p>

<p class='c017'>L. Aged 11. From great violence done her person will
be a cripple for life. No use of her lower extremities.</p>

<p class='c017'>M. Aged about 10. Crawled to hospital on her hands and
knees. Has never been able to stand erect since her
marriage.</p>

<p class='c017'>N. Aged 9. Dislocation of <em>pubic arch</em>, and unable to
stand, or to put one foot before the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>In view of the above facts, the undersigned lady doctors and
medical practitioners appeal to your Excellency’s compassion to
enact or introduce a measure by which the consummation of
marriage will not be permitted before the wife has attained the
full age of fourteen (14) years. The undersigned venture to
trust that the terrible urgency of the matter will be accepted as
an excuse for this interruption of your Excellency’s time and
attention.</p>

<div class='c018'>(Signed by 55 lady-physicians.)</div>

<p class='c011'>The memorial as above was initiated by Mrs. Monelle
Mansell, M.A., M.D., who has been in practice in India for
seventeen years, and it received the signature of every other
lady doctor there. The cases of abuse above specified are
“only a few out of many hundreds—of cruel wrongs,
deaths, and maimings for life received by helpless child-wives
at the hands of brutal husbands, which have come
under Dr. Monelle Mansell’s personal observation, or that
of her associates.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With regard to case K, and “lawful” use, compare what
is said by Dr. Emma B. Ryder, who is also in medical
practice in India, concerning the “Little Wives of India”:—“If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>I could take my readers with me on my round of
visits for one week, and let them behold the condition of
the little wives&#160;... if you could see the suffering
faces of the little girls, who are drawn nearly double with
contractions caused by the brutality of their husbands, and
who will never be able to stand erect; if you could see the
paralysed limbs that will not again move in obedience to
the will; if you could hear the plaintive wail of the little
sufferers as, with their tiny hands clasped, they beg you ‘to
make them die,’ and then turn and listen to the brutal
remarks of the legal owner with regard to the condition of
his property. If you could stand with me by the side of the
little deformed dead body, and, turning from the sickening
sight, could be shown the new victim to whom the brute was
already betrothed, do you think it would require long arguments
to convince you that there was a deadly wrong somewhere,
and that someone was responsible for it? After one
such scene a Hindoo husband said to me, ‘You look like feel
bad’ (meaning sad); ‘doctors ought not to care what see.
I don’t care what see, nothing trouble me, only when self
sick; I not like to have pain self.’... A man may be
a vile and loathsome creature, he may be blind, a lunatic,
an idiot, a leper, or diseased in a worse form; he may be
fifty, seventy, or a hundred years old, and may be married to
a baby or a girl of five or ten, who positively loathes his
presence, but if he claims her she must go, and the English
law for the ‘Restitution of Conjugal Rights’ compels her to
remain in his power, or imprisons her if she refuses. There
is no other form of slavery on the face of the earth that
begins with the slavery as enforced upon these little girls of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>India.”—(“The Home-Maker,” New York, June, 1891,
quoted in the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, Vol. IV., p. 38.)</p>

<p class='c011'>And the <cite>Times</cite> of 11th November, 1889, reported from
its Calcutta correspondent:—“Two shocking cases of wife-killing
lately came before the courts—in both cases the
result of child-marriage. In one a child aged ten was
strangled by her husband. In the second case a child of
ten years was ripped open with a wooden peg. Brutal
sexual exasperation was the sole apparent reason in both
instances. Compared with the terrible evils of child-marriage,
widow cremation is of infinitely inferior magnitude.
The public conscience is continually being affronted with
these horrible atrocities, but, unfortunately, native public
opinion generally seems to accept these revelations with
complete apathy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For what slight legislative amendment has recently been
effected in the grievances mentioned by Dr. Ryder, see
Note XXIV., 4. The “Restitution of Conjugal Rights,” so
justly condemned by her, does, indeed, appear to have
had—by some inadvertence—a recognition in the Indian
Courts which was not its lawful due. But for some fuller
particulars on this matter, both as concerns India and
England, see Note XXXVI., 6.</p>

with respiration, belong to this category. These
movements, though in the main independent of will, are
capable of being very considerably modified thereby, and
while they are most frequently unheeded, they have a very
recognisable accompaniment of feeling when attention is
distinctly turned to them.... The contraction of
oviducts or of the womb, as well as the movements concerned
in respiration, also had their beginnings in forms of
life whose advent is now buried in the immeasurable past.”—Dr.

<p class='c011'>“Let it be granted that the more frequently psychical
states occur in a certain order, the stronger becomes their
tendency to cohere in that order, until they at last become
inseparable; let it be granted that this tendency is, in however
slight a degree, inherited, so that if the experiences
remain the same, each successive generation bequeaths a
somewhat increased tendency, and it follows that, in cases
like the one described, there must eventually result an
automatic connection of nervous actions, corresponding to
the external relations perpetually experienced. Similarly,
if from some change in the environment of any species its
members are frequently brought in contact with a relation
having terms a little more involved; if the organisation of
the species is so far developed as to be impressible by these
terms in close succession, then an inner relation corresponding
to this new outer relation will gradually be formed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and will, in the end, become organic. And so on in subsequent

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “The ‘set’ of mind, as Professor Tyndall
well calls it, whether, as he says, ‘impressed upon the molecules
of the brain,’ or conveyed in any other way, is quite as
much a human as an animal phenomenon. Perhaps the
greater part of those qualities which we call the characteristics
of race are nothing else but the ‘set’ of the minds of
men transmitted from generation to generation, stronger and
more marked when the deeds are repeated, weaker and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>fainter as they fall into disuse.... Tyndall says: ‘No
mother can wash or suckle her baby without having a “set”
towards washing and suckling impressed upon the molecules
of her brain, and this set, according to the laws of
hereditary transmission, is passed on to her daughter. Not
only, therefore, does the woman at the present day suffer
deflection from intellectual pursuits through her proper
motherly instincts, but inherited proclivities act upon her
mind like a multiplying galvanometer, to augment indefinitely
the amount of the deflection. <em>Tendency</em> is immanent
even in spinsters, to warp them from intellect to baby-love.’
(Essay: “Odds and Ends of Alpine Life.”) Thus, if we
could, by preaching our pet ideal, or in any other way
induce one generation of women to turn to a new pursuit,
we should have accomplished a step towards bending all
future womanhood in the same direction.”—Frances Power

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “<em>The general maturity of the whole frame</em> is
the true indication that the individual, whether male or
female, has reached a fit age to reproduce the species. It is
not one small and unimportant symptom by which this question
must be judged. Many things go to make up virility in
man; the beard, the male voice, the change in figure, and
the change in disposition; and in girls there is a long
period of development in the bust, in the hips, in bone and
muscle, changes which take years for their proper accomplishment
before the girl can be said to have grown into a
woman. All this is not as a rule completed before the age
of twenty. Woman’s form is not well developed before she
is twenty years old; her pelvis, which has been called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>laboratory of generation, has not its perfect shape until then;
hence an earlier maternity is not desirable. If the demand
is made on the system before that, the process of development
is necessarily interfered with, and both mother and
offspring suffer. Even in countries where the age of marriage
is between twenty and twenty-five, where, therefore,
the mother has not been weakened by early maternity, it is
remarked that the strongest children are born to parents of
middle age, <em>i.e.</em>, from thirty-five to forty; this, the prime of
life to the parent, is the happiest moment for the advent of
her progeny.”—Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Address to the
Hindoos).</p>

      <div class='line'>8.—“<em>Abnormal fruits of birth</em>&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. John Thorburn, in his “Lecture introductory to the
Summer Course on Obstetric Medicine,” Victoria University,
Manchester, 1884, says:—“Let me briefly remind you
of what occurs at each menstrual period. During nearly one
week out of every four there occurs the characteristic
phenomenon of menstruation, which in itself has some
temporary <em>impoverishing effect</em>, though, in health, nature
speedily provides the means of recuperation. Along with
this we have a marked disturbance in the circulation of the
pelvis, leading to alterations in the weight, conformation,
and position of the <em>uterus</em>. We have also tissue changes
occurring, <em>not perhaps yet thoroughly understood</em>, but leading
to ruptures in the ovary, and to exfoliation of the uterine
lining membrane, <em>a kind of modified abortion, in fact</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>These changes in most instances are accompanied by signs
of pain and discomfort, which, if they were not periodic
and physiological, would be considered as symptoms of
disease.”</p>

<p class='c011'>(The italics are not in the original.) Here is certainly
cogent evidence of “abnormal fruit of birth,” and the
learned doctor seems to be on the verge of making the
involuntary discovery. But he follows the usual professional
attempt (see Note XXX., 4) to class menstruation as
a physiological and not a pathological fact; as a natural,
painful incident, and not an acquired painful consequence.
His half-declared argument, that, because an epoch of pain
is periodic it is therefore not symptomatic of disease, is a
theory as unsatisfactory as novel.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Some of the facts connected with parthenogenesis,
alternate generation, the impregnation of insects,
&amp;c., passed on through more than one generation,
would show by analogy this class of phenomena not extranatural
or unprecedented, but abnormal and capable of
rectification or reduction to pristine normality or non-existence.
The fact of occasional instances of absence of
menstruation, yet with a perfect potentiality of child-bearing,
indicates this latter possibility. That the male
being did not correspondingly suffer in personal physiological
sequence is explicable on the ground that the
masculine bodily function of parentage cannot be subjected
to equal forced sexual abuse; though in the male sex also
there is indication that excess may leave hereditary functional
trace. And that, again, a somewhat analogous
physical abnormality may be induced by man in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>animals, compare the intelligent words of George Eliot in
her poem, “A Minor Prophet”:—</p>

the Herds of Wild Cattle in Chartley Park, and other parks
in Great Britain.” The Committee state, concerning a herd
of wild cattle at Somerford Park, near Congleton, of which
herd “the cows are all regularly milked,” that “The udders
of the cows here are as large as in ordinary domestic cows,
which is not the case in the herds which are not milked.”—(“Report
of the British Association,” 1887, p. 141.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say ‘We marry our girls when they reach puberty,’
and you take as indication of that stage one only, and that
the least certain, of the many changes which go to make up
maturity. It is the least certain because the most variable,
and dependent more upon climate and conditions of life
than upon any true physical development. No one would
deny that a strong country girl of thirteen was more mature
physically than a girl of eleven brought up in the close,
unwholesome atmosphere of a crowded city, yet you say the
latter has attained to puberty, and that the former has not.
Into such discrepancies has this physiological error led you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Without going into the domain of physiology for proof of
assertion, let me draw your attention to the very practical
proof of its truth, which you have in the fact well-known to
you all, that girls married at this so-called period of puberty
do not, as a rule, bear children till some years later, <em>i.e.</em>, till
they really approach maturity. I allow that you share this
error with all but modern physiologists. Even if marriage
is delayed till fourteen, where conception takes place immediately,
sterility follows after; but where the girl is strong
and healthy there is a lapse of three or four years before
child-bearing begins, a proof that puberty had not been
reached till then, although menstruation had been all the
time existent. Of course there are exceptional cases, but
does not the consensus of experience point to these as
general truths?”—Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Address to

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Of this, as existent to the present age, abundant direct
and collateral evidence is given by a <em>brochure</em> entitled “A
Practical View of the Age of Consent Act, for the benefit
of the Mahomedan community in general, by the Committee
of the Mahomedan Literary Society of Calcutta,”
published by that Society, in June, 1891, as “an accurate
exposition of the object and scope of the new law, in the
clearest possible language, for the benefit of the Mahomedans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>particularly the ignorant classes, and circulated widely
in the vernacular languages for that purpose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The following are extracts from the pamphlet:—</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 1. “Now that the Age of Consent Act has been
passed by his Excellency the Viceroy, in Council, and as there
is every likelihood of its provisions not being sufficiently well
understood by the Mahomedan community in general, and by
the ignorant Mahomedans in particular, owing to the use of
technical legal phraseology in the drafting of the Act, it seems
to the Committee of Management of the Mahomedan Literary
Society of Calcutta, to be highly desirable that the object and
intention of the Government in passing this Act, as well as its
scope and the manner in which it is to be administered by the
Criminal Authorities, should be laid down on paper in the
clearest and easiest language possible, for the information and
instruction of the Mahomedan population, and particularly of
such of them as are not conversant with legal technicalities.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 2. “The Committee are of opinion that such a course
will be highly beneficial to members of their community, inasmuch
as it will show to them distinctly what action on the part
of a Mahomedan husband towards his young wife has been
made, by the recent legislation, a heinous criminal offence of
no less enormity than the offence of <em>rape</em>, and punishable with
the same heavy punishment.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 3. “It is hoped that they will thereby be put on their
guard against committing, or allowing the commission of an
act which <em>they have hitherto been accustomed to think lawful
and innocent</em>, but which has now been made into a heinous
offence....”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 9. “... There has already been a provision in
the Indian Penal Code, passed more than thirty years ago, that
a man having sexual intercourse with his own wife, with or
without her consent, she <em>being under the age of ten years</em>, shall
be considered guilty of the offence of <em>rape</em>, and shall be liable to
transportation for life, or to rigorous or simple imprisonment for
ten years.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 10. “From this it follows that, under the Penal Code
a man having sexual intercourse with his own wife, with or without
her consent, if she is <em>above ten</em> years of age, shall not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>considered to have committed the offence of <em>rape</em>. But the
Act that has just been passed, in amendment of the above provision
in the Penal Code, <em>raises</em> the age of consent from <em>ten</em> to
<em>twelve</em> years, and provides that a man having sexual intercourse
with his own wife, even with her consent, shall be considered
to be guilty of the offence of rape, if the wife be of any
age under <em>twelve completed years</em>. This is all the change that
has been made in the law.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 11. “It having been ascertained, from various sources,
that in some parts of the country husbands cohabit with their
wives before they have attained to the age of <em>twelve</em> years, and
even before they have arrived at <em>puberty</em>, the result of such
intercourse being in many cases to cause injury to the health,
and even danger to the life of the girls, and to generate internal
maladies which make them miserable throughout their lives,
and such a state of things having come to the notice of Government,
they have considered it their duty to put a stop to it, and
this is the object of the present legislation.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 12. “The law does not interfere with the age at which
a girl may be married, but simply prohibits sexual intercourse
with her by her husband before she is <em>twelve</em> years of age.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 13. “It is therefore <em>incumbent</em> upon all husbands and
their guardians (if they are very young and inexperienced lads)
to be very careful that sexual intercourse does not take place
until the girl-wife has <em>passed</em> the age of <em>twelve</em> years. It will
also be the duty of the guardians of the girl-wife not to allow
her husband to cohabit with her until she has attained that
age.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 17. “... The Mahomedan law (<em>i.e.</em>, religious
law) distinctly sanctions consummation of marriage <em>only</em> when
the wife has reached puberty, and has besides attained such
physical development as renders her fit for sexual intercourse,
and it is <em>not imperative</em> upon a Mahomedan husband to consummate
marriage with his wife when she is <em>under</em> the age of
<em>twelve</em> years. Even in those rare cases in which the wife
attains to puberty and the necessary physical development
before the age of <em>twelve</em>, a Mahomedan husband <em>may</em>, without
infringing any canon of the Mahommedan Ecclesiastical Law,
<em>abstain</em> from consummating his marriage with her <em>until</em> she
attains that age.</p>

<p class='c004'>Par. 18. “The above will clearly show that the Act recently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>passed by the Legislature does not, in any way, interfere with
the Mahomedan religion, and <em>no</em> Mahomedan husband will be
considered to have committed a sin if he abstains from consummating
marriage with his wife <em>before</em> she is <em>twelve</em> years of
age.”</p>

Literary Society of Calcutta, of which the patron is

<p class='c011'>The italics, as above, exist in the original (with the exception
of those in Par. 3), and serve, singularly enough, to
point for us a moral very much deeper than that intended.
It is a happy fact that British feeling, supported by the growing
sentiment of the more intelligent and educated of the
native population, has effected even so slight an amelioration
of law and custom, and we may hope for and press
forward to further improvement. Though the utterance
quoted above is only that of the Mahomedan section, it is,
of course, understood that the law does not apply or point to
them alone, but to all the peoples and sects of India; and
that the approval of this legislation is also general among
the enlightened of those other creeds. (See end of Note
XVII., 8.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Singular confirmatory evidence as to the distressing prevalence
of this child-marriage is incidentally given in the
following paragraph from the <cite>Times</cite> of 31st March, 1892:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“A correspondent of the <cite>Times of India</cite> mentions some odd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>instances of minor difficulties which have occurred in the working
of the amended Factory Act, which came into force in India
at the commencement of the present year. The limit of age
for ‘full-timers’ in factories is fixed at fourteen years, and as
very few native operatives know their children’s ages, or even
their own, the medical officer has, in passing lads and girls for
work, to judge the age as best he can—generally, as in the case
of horses, by examining their teeth. If he concludes that they
are under fourteen, he reduces them to ‘half-timers.’ In one
Bombay mill recently a number of girls were thus sent back as
under age who were actually mothers, and several boys who
were fathers were also reduced; and one of the latter was the
father, it is said, of three children. The case of these lads is
particularly hard, for, with a wife and child, or perhaps children,
to support, life, on the pay of a ‘half-timer,’ must be a terrible
struggle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lest it should be objected that such abuses—with their
consequences—as have been instanced in India, are
peculiar to that country or civilisation, and that their discussion
has therefore no bearing on our practices in England,
and the physical consequences ensuant here, it will
be salutary to recall what has been our own national conduct
in this matter of enforcement of immature physical
relations on girl children or “wives” within times of by no
means distant date. Blackstone tells in his “Commentaries,”
Book II., Chap. VIII., that “The wife must be above nine
years old at her husband’s death, otherwise she shall not be
endowed, though in Bracton’s time the age was indefinite,
and dower was then only due ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">si uxor possit dotem promereri,
<em>et virum sustinere</em></span>.’” Whereupon Ed. Christian makes the
following note, worthy of the most careful meditation:—“Lord
Coke informs us that ‘if the wife be past the age of
nine years at the time of her husband’s death, she shall be
endowed, of what age soever her husband be, albeit he were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>but <em>four</em> years old. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quia junior non potest dotem promereri,
<em>et virum sustinere</em>.</span>’ (Coke on Litt., 33.) This we are told
by that grave and reverend judge without any remark of surprise
or reprobation. But it confirms the observation of
Montesquieu in the ‘Spirit of Laws,’ Book XXVI., Chap.
III. ‘There has been,’ says he, ‘much talk of a law in
England which permitted girls seven years old to choose a
husband. This law was shocking two ways; it had no
regard to the time when Nature gives maturity to the understanding,
nor to the time when she gives maturity to the
body.’ It is abundantly clear, both from our law and
history, that formerly such early marriages were contracted
as in the present times are neither attempted nor thought
of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was probably owing to the right which the lord
possessed of putting up to sale the marriage of his infant
tenant. He no doubt took the first opportunity of prostituting
(<em>i.e.</em>, selling in marriage) the infant to his own
interest, without any regard to age or inclinations. And
thus what was so frequently practised and permitted by the
law would cease even in other instances to be considered
with abhorrence. <em>If the marriage of a female was delayed
till she was sixteen, this benefit was entirely lost to the lord
her guardian.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“Even the 18 Eliz., cap. 7, which makes it a capital
crime to abuse a consenting female child under the age of
ten years, seems to leave an exception for these marriages by
declaring only the <em>carnal and unlawful</em> knowledge of such
woman-child to be a felony. Hence the abolition of the
feudal wardships and marriage at the Restoration may perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>have contributed not less to the improvement of the
morals than of the liberty of the people.”—(Blackstone’s
Comm., Christian’s Edition, 1830, Vol. II., p. 131.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Revolting was the shock to the writer, coming, some
years ago, with unprejudiced and ingenuous mind, to the
study of the so-called “Diseases of Women,” on finding
that nearly the whole of these special “diseases,” including
menstruation, were due, directly or collaterally, to one form
or other of <em>masculine</em> excess or abuse. Here is a nearly
coincident opinion, afterwards met with:—“The diseases
peculiar to women are so many, of so frequent occurrence,
and of such severity, that half the time of the medical profession
is devoted to their care, and more than half its
revenues depend upon them. We have libraries of books
upon them, special professorships in our medical colleges,
and hosts of doctors who give them their exclusive attention....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The books and professors are all at fault.
They have no knowledge of the causes or nature of these
diseases” (or at least they do not publish it, or act on it),
“and no idea of their proper treatment. Women are everywhere
outraged and abused. When the full chapter of
woman’s wrongs and sufferings is written, the world will be
horrified at the hideous spectacle....”—T. L.
Nichols, M.D. (“Esoteric Anthropology,” p. 198).</p>

<p class='c011'>So, again, in speaking of menorrhagia:—“The causes of
this disease, whatever they are, must be removed. Thousands
of women are consigned to premature graves; some
by the morbid excesses of their own passions, but far more
by the sensual and selfish indulgences of those who claim
the legal right to murder them in this manner, whom no
law of homicide can reach, and upon whose victims no
coroner holds an inquest.”—(<em>Op. cit.</em>, p. 301.)</p>

Lombroso, of Turin (at the International Congress of
Psychology, London), in which occurs the following:—“It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>must be observed that woman was exposed to more pains
than man, because man imposed submission and often even
slavery upon her. As a girl, she had to undergo the
tyranny of her brothers, and the cruel preferences accorded
by parents to their male children. Woman was the slave of
her husband, and still more of social prejudices....
Let them not forget the physical disadvantage under which
she had to labour. She might justly call herself the pariah
of the human family.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The word is apt and corroborative, for it was no honest
act—it was not Nature, but human cruelty and injustice
that formed a pariah.</p>

moment des règles pouvaient dessécher les arbres par de
simples attouchements, faire périr des fruits, &amp;c., &amp;c.</span>” And
a further writer says more fully:—“Pliny informs us that
the presence of a menstrual woman turns wine sour, causes
trees to shed their fruit, parches up their young fruit, and
makes them for ever barren, dims the splendour of mirrors
and the polish of ivory, turns the edge of sharpened iron,
converts brass into rust, and is the cause of canine rabies.
In Isaiah xxx. 22, the writer speaks of the defilement of
graven images, which shall be cast away as a menstruous
cloth; and in Ezekiel xviii. 6, and xxxvi. 17, allusions
of the same import are made.” Unless we accept the
antiquated notion of a “special curse” on women, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>reconcile the idea of an “ordinance of Nature” being so
repulsively and opprobriously alluded to? Well may it be
said:—“Ingratitude is a hateful vice. Not only the
defects, but even the illnesses which have their source in the
excessive” (man-caused) “susceptibility of woman, are often
made by men an endless subject of false accusations and
pitiless reproaches.”—(M. le Docteur Cerise, in his Introduction

of a specified medicament.] “It was given in <em>three successive</em>

eight or ten doses had been administered, and expulsion was
effected by the end of the third day. It was perseveringly

Medical records are full of similar histories. To the unsophisticated
mind, two questions sternly suggest themselves:
Firstly, Is it meet or right for an honourable profession, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>any individual member of it, to be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">particeps criminis</span></i> in such
proceedings as the above? and, secondly, is the indicated
connubial morality on any higher level, or likely to be attended
with any better consequences, than the prior ignorant
or savage abuses which are responsible for woman’s
present physical condition?</p>

<p class='c011'>The advocacy of cardinal reform in this direction—in the
wrong done both to the individual and the race—is urgent
part of the duty of our newly-taught medical women. Nor
are their eyes closed nor their mouths dumb in the matter.
Dr. Caroline B. Winslow is quoted by the <cite>Woman’s Journal</cite>
of Boston, U.S., 16th Jan., 1892, as saying in an article on
“The Right to be Well Born”: “What higher motive can
a man have in life than to labour steadily to prepare the
way for the coming of a higher, better humanity?...
Dense ignorance prevails in our profession, and is reflected
by laymen. All their scientific studies and years of medical
practice have failed to convict men of the wrongs and outrages
done to women; wrongs that no divine laws sanction,
and no legal enactments can avert....</p>

<p class='c011'>“The physician is a witness of the modern death-struggles
and horrors of maternity; he sees lives pass out of
his sight; he makes vain attempts to restore broken constitutions,
broken by violating divine laws that govern organic
matter: laws that are obeyed by all animal instinct; yet all
this knowledge, observation, and experience have failed to
reveal to the benighted intellect and obtuse moral sense of
the ordinary practitioner this great wrong. He makes no
note of the unhallowed abuse that only man dares; neither
will he mark the disastrous and deteriorating effect of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>waste of vital force on his own offspring. The mental,
moral, and physical imperfections of the rising generation
are largely the result of outraged motherhood.”</p>

racked with pain; from every human being who has

drowned, burned, or slain by negligence, there goes up a

apart from surgery, as the study of suggestion.... Now

caused by suggestion, we are obliged to ascribe a much

hitherto done.”—Dr. Albert Moll (“Hypnotism,” pp. 122,

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “It would, I fancy, have fared but ill with
one who, standing where I now stand, in what was then a
thickly-peopled and fashionable part of London, should
have broached to our ancestors the doctrine which I now
propound to you—that all their hypotheses were alike
wrong; that the plague was no more, in their sense, Divine
judgment, than the fire was the work of any political, or of
any religious, sect; but that they were themselves the
authors of both plague and fire, and that they must look to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>themselves to prevent the recurrence of calamities, to all
appearance so peculiarly beyond the reach of human
control.... We, in later times, have learned somewhat
of Nature, and partly obey her. Because of this partial improvement
of our natural knowledge and of that fractional
obedience, we have no plague; because that knowledge is
still very imperfect and that obedience yet incomplete,
typhus is our companion and cholera our visitor. But it
is not presumptuous to express the belief that, when our
knowledge is more complete and our obedience the expression
of our knowledge, London will count her centuries
of freedom from typhus and cholera as she now gratefully
reckons her two hundred years of ignorance of that plague
which swooped upon her thrice in the first half of the
seventeenth century.”—T. H. Huxley (“On Improving
Natural Knowledge”).</p>

<p class='c011'>And the pestilent malady from which woman specially
still suffers is as definitely the result of man’s ignorant or

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Not only “sage” physician, but “brave” physician; for
brave indeed has been the part she has had to bear against
male professional prejudice and jealousy, opposition from
masculine vested interests, virulent abuse and even personal
violence. So recently as 1888, Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake has to
report concerning the medical education of women, that:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first difficulty lies in some remaining jealousy and ill-will
towards medical women on the part of a section (constantly
diminishing, as I believe) of the medical profession itself. Some
twenty years ago the professional prejudice was so deep and so
widely spread that it constituted a very formidable obstacle, but
it has been steadily melting away before the logic of facts; and
now is, with a few exceptions, rarely to be found among the
leaders of the profession, nor indeed among the great majority
of the rank and file, as far as can be judged by the personal experience
of medical women themselves. Unfortunately, it seems
strongest just where it has least justification, viz., among the
practitioners who devote themselves chiefly to midwifery, and to
the special diseases of women. The Obstetrical Society is, so
far as I know, still of the same mind as when, in 1874, they excluded
Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, a distinguished M.D.
of Paris, from their membership; and the Soho Square Hospital
for Women has never revoked its curt refusal to allow me to
enter its doors, when, in 1878, I proposed to take advantage of
the invitation issued in its report to all practitioners who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>specially interested in the cases for which the hospital is reserved.
Sometimes this jealousy takes a sufficiently comic form.
For instance, I received for two successive years a lithographed
circular inviting me by name to send to the <cite>Lancet</cite> the reports
of interesting cases that might occur in my dispensary practice,
but when I wrote in response to this supposed offer of professional
fellowship, I received by next post a hurried assurance
from the editor that it was all a mistake, and that, in fact, the
<cite>Lancet</cite> could not stoop to record medical experiences, however
interesting, if they occurred in the practice of the inferior sex!
Probably it will not require many more years to make this sort
of thing ridiculous, even in the eyes of those who are now
capable of such puerilities.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The second obstacle lies in the continued exclusion of
women from the majority of our Universities, and from the
English Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. Here also the
matter may be left to the growth of public opinion as regards
those existing bodies which do not depend upon the public
purse; but it is time that Parliament should refuse supplies to
those bodies whose sense of justice cannot be otherwise
awakened, and it is certainly the duty of Government to see
that no new charter is granted without absolute security for
equal justice to students of both sexes.”—Sophia Jex-Blake,
M.D. (<cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, Nov., 1887).</p>

<p class='c011'>See also Note LVII., 1, and LVIII, 1.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Progress is indeed being made, surely, yet
slowly, for Mrs. Fawcett has still necessity to reiterate,
four years afterwards:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Make her a doctor, put her through the mental discipline
and the physical toil of the profession; charge her, as doctors
are so often charged, with the health of mind and body
of scores of patients, she remains womanly to her finger
tips, and a good doctor in proportion as the truly womanly
qualities in her are strongly developed. Poor women are
very quick to find this out as patients. Not only from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the immediate neighbourhood of the New Hospital for
Women, where all the staff are women doctors, but also
from the far East of London do they come, because ‘the
ladies,’ as they call them, are ladies, and show their poor
patients womanly sympathy, gentleness, and patience,
womanly insight and thoughtfulness in little things, and
consideration for their home troubles and necessities. It
is not too much to say that a woman can never hope to
be a good doctor unless she is truly and really a womanly
woman. And much the same thing may be said with regard
to fields of activity not yet open to women.”—Mrs.
Fawcett (<cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, Nov., 1891).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>—“... <em>saviour of her sex</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bebel says:—“Women doctors would be the greatest
blessing to their own sex. The fact that women must place
themselves in the hands of men in cases of illness or of the
physical disturbances connected with their sexual functions
frequently prevents their seeking medical help in time. This
gives rise to numerous evils, not only for women, but also for
men. Every doctor complains of this reserve on the part of
women, which sometimes becomes almost criminal, and of
their dislike to speak freely of their ailments, even after
they have made up their minds to consult a doctor. This is
perfectly natural, the only irrational thing about it is the
refusal of men, and especially of doctors, to recognise how
legitimate the study of medicine is for women.” (“Woman,”
Walther’s translation, p. 131.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “As I am alluding to my own experience in
this matter, I may perhaps be allowed to say how often in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the same place I have been struck with the <em>contingent</em>
advantages attendant on the medical care by women of
women; how often I have seen cases connected with stories
of shame or sorrow to which a woman’s hand could far
more fittingly minister, and where sisterly help and counsel
could give far more appropriate succour than could be
expected from the average young medical man, however
good his intentions. Perhaps we shall find the solution of
some of our saddest social problems, when educated and
pure-minded women are brought more constantly in contact
with their sinning and suffering sisters, in other relations as
well as those of missionary effort.”—Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake

women practitioners; and the writer has had detailed personal

<p class='c011'>The Report of the British Association for 1850, in summarising
the paper above referred to (Note 1), says of Dr.
Tilt that, “in discussing what he calls the intrinsic causes
which have been supposed to influence menstruation, his
observations are rather of a suggestive character, for he
considers such causes highly problematical and requiring
further investigation.” Dr. Tilt rightly emphasises the
question as “a matter equally interesting to the physician,
the philosopher, and the statesman; and it behoves them to
know that this epoch (of menstruation) varies under the
influence of causes which for the most part have been

reprobated in the verse has again supervened.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Buckle says, concerning this same paper of Dr. Tilt’s:
“We take shame to ourselves for not having sooner noticed
this very interesting and in some respects very important
work; the author unknown,” (?) “and yet the book has gone
through two editions, though written on a subject ignorantly
supposed to be going on well. That women can be satisfied
with their state shows their deterioration. That they
can be satisfied with knowing nothing, &amp;c.” (<em>sic.</em>) (“Miscellaneous
and Posthumous Works,” Vol. I., p. 381.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The whole passage seems somewhat incoherent, and is
unfinished as above, as if left by Mr. Buckle for further
consideration. The last two remarks as to women are certainly
not written with his usual justice; when we remember
how assiduously men have striven to prevent woman’s
pursuit of physiological knowledge, especially as applied to
her own person, it is manifest that the blame for woman’s
ignorance, or her presumed “satisfaction” therewith, is
more fittingly to be reproached to man than to her.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“It is well-known that every organ of the body and, therefore,
also the brain, requires for its full development and,
consequently, for the development of its complete capability
of performance, exercise and persistent effort. That this is
and has been the case for thousands of years in a far less
degree in woman than in man, in consequence of her
defective training and education, will be denied by no one.”
So says the learned biologist Büchner.—(“Man,” Dallas’s
translation, p. 206.)</p>

<p class='c011'>And Bebel also declares:—“The brain must be regularly
used and correspondingly nourished, like any other organ,
if its faculties are to be fully developed.”—(“Woman,”
Walther’s translation, p. 124.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Emanuel Bonavia, in the course of an able reply to
a somewhat shallow recent disquisition by Sir James
Crichton Browne, says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“From various sources we have learnt that the brain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>tissue, like every other tissue, will <em>grow</em> by exercise, and
diminish, or degenerate and atrophy by disuse. Keep your
right arm tied up in a sling for a month, and you will then
be convinced how much it has lost by disuse. Then anatomists
might perhaps be able to say—Lo! and behold!
the muscles of your right arm have a less specific gravity
than those of your left arm; that the nerves and blood-vessels
going to those muscles are smaller, and that,
<em>therefore</em>, the right arm cannot be the equal of the left, and
must have a different function!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any medical student knows that if you tie the main
trunk of an artery, a branch of it will in due course acquire
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calibre</span></i> of the main trunk. If, for some reason, it cannot
do so, the tissues, which the main trunk originally supplied,
<em>must</em> suffer, and be weakened, from want of a sufficient
supply of blood.... Man, and especially British
man, has evolved into what he is by endless trouble and
struggle through past ages. He has had to develop his
present brain from very small beginnings. It would, therefore,
now be the height of folly to allow the thinking lobes
of the mothers of the race to revert, intellectually, by
disuse step by step again to that of the lower animals, from
which we all come. That of course many may not believe,
but it may be asked, how can he or she believe these things
with such weakened lobes, as he or she may have inherited
from his or her mother? How indeed! If there is
anything in nature that is true, it is this—That if you don’t
use your limbs they will atrophy; if you don’t use your
eyes they will atrophy; if you don’t use your brain it will
atrophy. They all follow the same inexorable law. Use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>increases and sharpens; disuse decreases and dulls.
Diminished size of the frontal lobes and of the arteries that
feed them mean nothing if they do not mean that woman’s
main thinking organ, that of the intellect, is, as Sir James
would hint, degenerating by <em>disuse</em> and neglect.”—(“Woman’s
Frontal Lobes,” <cite>Provincial Medical Journal</cite>,
July, 1892.)</p>

<p class='c011'>These facts suggest strongly that the waste at present
induced in the female body by the menstrual habit might
well be absorbed in increase of brain power; and indeed,
that this evolved habit has hitherto persistently sequestrated
and carried off from woman’s organism the blood force that
should have gone to form brain power. This explanation
would dispose of the awkwardly imagined “plethora”
theory, as well as one or two others, of sundry gynæcologists.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the converse—that the increased appropriation of
the blood in forming brain power induces a state of bodily
well-being, free from the present waste and weariness,—would
certainly seem to be borne out by such evidence as
that of the Hon. John W. Mitchell, the president of the
Southern California College of Law, who said in a recent
lecture:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not only in this, but in other countries, there are
successful women practitioners (of Law), and in France,
where the preparatory course is most arduous, and the term
of study longest, a woman recently took the highest rank
over 500 men in her graduating examinations, and during
the whole six years of class study she only lost one day
from her work.” (See Note LVII., 1.)</p>

<p class='c011'>A few words may here be said as to the dubitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>question of the relative size of the brain in man and
woman, though the matter may not be of great import, from
more than one reason. For, as Bebel observes: “Altogether
the investigations on the subject are too recent and
too few in number to allow of any definite conclusions”
(p. 123). A. Dumas fils says <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">(“Les Femmes qui Tuent,” p.
196)—“Les philosophes vous démontreront que, si la force
musculaire de l’homme est plus grande que celle de la
femme, la force nerveuse de la femme est plus grande que
celle de l’homme; que, si l’intelligence tient, comme on
l’affirme aujourd’hui, au développement et au poids de la
matière cérébrale, l’intelligence de la femme pourrait être
déclarée supérieure à celle de l’homme, le plus grand
cerveau et le plus lourd comme poids, étant un cerveau de
femme lequel pesait 2,200 grammes, c’est a dire 400
grammes de plus que celui de Cuvier. On ne dit pas, il est
vrai, que cette femme ait écrit l’équivalent du livre de
Cuvier sur les fossiles.”</span></p>

<p class='c011'>To which last remark may be replied, again in the words
of Bebel,—“Darwin is perfectly right in saying that a list
of the most distinguished women in poetry, painting, sculpture,
music, science, and philosophy, will bear no comparison
with a similar list of the most distinguished men. But
surely this need not surprise us. It would be surprising if
it were not so. Dr. Dodel-Port (in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die neuere Schöpfungsgeschichte</span>”)
answers to the point, when he maintains
that the relative achievements would be very different after
men and women had received the same education and the
same training in art and science during a certain number
of generations.”—(“Woman,” p. 125.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“It is of small value to say—yes, but look how <em>many</em>
men excel and how few women do so. True, but see how
much repression men have exercised to <em>prevent</em> women from
even equalling them, and how much shallowness of mind
they have encouraged. All manner of obstructions, coupled
with ridicule, have been put in their way, and until women
succeed in emancipating themselves, most men will probably
continue to do so, simply because they have the
power to do it. When women become emancipated, that
is, are placed on social equality with men, this senseless,
mischievous opposition will die a natural death.”—E.
Bonavia, M.D. (“Woman’s Frontal Lobes”).</p>

<p class='c011'>To revert to the question of brain weight, one of the first
of English specialists says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Data might, therefore, be considered to show, in the
strongest manner, how comparatively unimportant is mere
bulk or weight of brain in reference to the degree of intelligence
of its owner, when considered as it often is, apart
from the much more important question of the relative
amount of its grey matter, as well as of the amount and
perfection of the minute internal development of the organ
either actual or possible.”—Dr. H. C. Bastian (“The Brain as
an Organ of Mind,” p. 375.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The American physiologist Helen H. Gardener states:—“The
differences (in brain) between individuals of the same
sex—in adults at least, are known to be much more marked
than any that are known to exist between the sexes. Take
the brains of the two poets Byron and Dante. Byron’s
weighed 1,807 grammes, while Dante’s weighed only 1,320
grammes, a difference of 487 grammes. Or take two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>statesmen, Cromwell and Gambetta. Cromwell’s brain
weighed 2,210 grammes, which, by the way, is the greatest
healthy brain on record; although Cuvier’s is usually quoted
as the largest, a part of the weight of his was due to disease,
and if a diseased or abnormal brain is to be taken as
the standard, then the greatest on record is that of a negro
criminal idiot; while Gambetta’s was only 1,241 grammes, a
difference of 969 grammes. Surely it will not be held
because of this that Gambetta and Dante should have
been denied the educational and other advantages which
were the natural right of Byron and Cromwell. Yet it is
upon this very ground, by this very system of reasoning,
that it is proposed to deny women equal advantages and
opportunities, although the difference in brain weight
between man and woman is said to be only 100 grammes,
and even this does not allow for difference in body weight,
and is based upon a system of averages, which is neither
complete nor accurate.”—(Report of the International
Council of Women, Washington, 1888, p. 378.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Concerning an assertion that “the specific gravity of both
the white and grey matter of the brain is greater in man than
in woman,” Helen H. Gardener says:—“Of this point this is
what the leading brain anatomist in America (Dr. E. C.
Spitzka) wrote: ‘The only article recognised by the profession
as important and of recent date, which takes this
theory as a working basis, is by Morselli, and he is compelled
to make the sinister admission, while asserting that
the specific gravity is less in the female, that with old age
and with insanity the specific gravity increases.’ If this is
the case I do not know that women need sigh over their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>shortcoming in the item of specific gravity. There appear
to be two very simple methods open to them by which they
may emulate their brothers in the matter of specific gravity,
if they so desire. One of these is certain, if they live long
enough; and the other—well, there is no protective tariff on
insanity.”—(<em>Loc. cit.</em>, p. 379.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Helen Gardener further appositely observes:—“The
brain of no remarkable woman has ever been examined.
Woman is ticketed to fit the hospital subjects and tramps,
the unfortunates whose brains fall into the hands of the
profession as it were by mere accident, while man is represented
by the brains of the Cromwells, Cuviers, Byrons, and
Spurzheims. By this method the average of men’s brains
is carried to its highest level in the matter of weight and
texture; while that of women is kept at its lowest, and
even then there is only claimed 100 grammes’ difference!”—(<em>Loc.
cit.</em>, p. 380.)</p>

<p class='c011'>And she concludes her exhaustive paper with the closing
paragraph of a letter to herself from Dr. E. C. Spitzka, the
celebrated New York brain specialist:—“You may hold me
responsible for the following declaration: That any statement
to the effect that an observer can tell by looking at a brain,
or examining it microscopically, whether it belonged to a
female or a male subject, is not founded on carefully-observed
facts.... No such difference has ever
been demonstrated, nor do I think it will be by more
elaborate methods than we now possess. Numerous female
brains exceed numerous male brains in absolute weight, in
complexity of convolutions, and in what brain anatomists
would call the nobler proportions. So that he who takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>these as his criteria of the male brain may be grievously
mistaken in attempting to assert the sex of a brain dogmatically.
If I had one hundred female brains and one
hundred male brains together, I should select the one
hundred containing the largest and best-developed brains as
probably containing fewer female brains than the remaining
one hundred. More than this no cautious experienced
brain anatomist would venture to declare.”—(<em>Loc. cit.</em>,
p. 381.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Charles Darwin has clearly summarised this question of
comparison of brain:—“No one, I presume, doubts that
the large size of the brain in man, relatively to his body, in
comparison with that of the gorilla or orang, is closely connected
with his higher mental powers.... On the
other hand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two
animals or of any two men can be accurately gauged by the
cubic contents of their skulls. It is certain that there may
be extraordinary mental activity with an extremely small
absolute mass of nervous matter; thus the wonderfully
diversified instincts, mental powers, and affections of ants
are generally known, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so
large as the quarter of a small pin’s head. Under this
latter point of view the brain of an ant is one of the most
marvellous atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more
marvellous than the brain of man.”—(“The Descent of
Man,” Chap. IV.)</p>

chose to do so, he shook his head thoughtfully, and, with a

<p class='c011'>This was, in fact, simply extending the spirit of the
feudal system (with its serfdom as just pictured), a little
further. Buckle exemplifies in ancient French society the
servility descending from one grade to another in man:—“By
virtue of which each class exercising great power over
the one below it, the subordination and subserviency of the
whole were completely maintained.... This, indeed,
is but part of the old scheme to create distinctions
for which Nature has given no warrant, to substitute a
superiority which is conventional for that which is real, and
thus try to raise little minds above the level of great ones.
The utter failure, and, as society advances, the eventual
cessation of all such attempts is certain.” But, meanwhile,
evil accompaniments are apparent, as Buckle further instances
by saying: “Le Vassor, who wrote late in the reign
of Louis XIV., bitterly says: ‘Les Français accoutumés à
l’esclavage, ne sentent plus la pesanteur de leurs chaînes.’”—(“History

naturally spreads to the other sex, would seem to be shown
by such evidence as Letourneau gives:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“In primitive countries the married woman—that is to
say, the woman belonging to a man—has herself the conscience
of being a thing, a property (it is proved to her often
and severely enough), but she does not think of retaliating,
especially in what concerns the conjugal relations. Moreover,
as her condition is oftenest that of a slave overburdened
with work, not only does she not resent the
introduction of other women in the house of the master,
but she desires it, for the work will be so much the less for
herself. Thus among the Zulus the wife first purchased
strives and works with ardour in the hope of furnishing her
husband with means to acquire a second wife, a companion
in misery over whom, by right of seniority, she will have the
upper hand.”—(“The Evolution of Marriage,” Chap. VIII.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, in point of fact, this is not woman seeking to
establish her own dominion, but rather to secure somewhat
more of freedom for herself. As Alexandre Dumas fils tells
us, concerning the Mormon women:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Non seulement elles donnent leur consentement à leurs
maris, quand ils le leur demandent pour un nouveau mariage,
mais elles sont quelquefois les premières à leur proposer une
nouvelle femme qui a, disent-elles, des qualités nécessaires
à la communauté, en réalité pour augmenter un peu la
possession d’elles-mêmes, c’est-à-dire leur liberté.”—(“Les
Femmes qui Tuent,” &amp;c., p. 169.)</span></p>

<p class='c011'>Letourneau shows the state of feminine tutelage carried
still further: “We shall find that in many civilisations
relatively advanced, widowhood even does not gratify the
woman with a liberty of which she is never thought worthy.”
And later on he quotes from the code of Manu, Book V.:—“A
little girl, a young woman, and an old woman ought
never to do anything of their own will, even in their own
house.... During her childhood a woman depends
on her father; during her youth on her husband; her
husband being dead, on her sons; if she has no sons, on
the near relatives of her husband; or in default of them, on
those of her father; if she has no paternal relatives, on the

capacity should prefer doing almost anything else, not in
their own eyes degrading, rather than marry, when marrying

earthly possessions. And truly, if this consequence were
necessarily incident to marriage, I think that the apprehension
would be very well founded.”—J S. Mill (“The Subjection

<p class='c011'>These dogmas which, under the guise of religion, were
imposed on the acceptance of womanhood, may be aptly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>summarised and epitomised in the following lines from one
of the hierarchs of the system:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorn’d:</div>

      <div class='line in16'>—(“Paradise Lost,” Book IV., 634.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Concerning which words of Milton well may Mary
Wollstonecraft observe, with a quiet sarcasm:—“If it be
allowed that women were destined by Providence to acquire
human virtues, and, by the exercise of their understandings,
that stability of character which is the firmest ground
to rest our future hopes upon, they must be permitted
to turn to the fountain of light, and not forced to shape
their course by the twinkling of a satellite.”—(“Vindication
of the Rights of Woman,” Chap. II.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Milton also discoursed learnedly, but self-interestedly,
concerning divorce, claiming for the husband a privilege
and option which he utterly denied to the wife:—“...
the power and arbitrement of divorce from the master of
the family, into whose hands God and the law of all
nations had put it&#160;... that right which God from
the beginning had entrusted to the husband.”—(“The
Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce.”)</p>

<p class='c011'>It was this same mediæval moralist who trained his
daughters in the pronunciation of various languages, that
they might minister to his comfort by reading to him in
those tongues; while he carefully withheld from them any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>knowledge of the meaning of the words they were uttering.
Could a greater insult or a more degrading office be inflicted
on a cultured human intellect? Small wonder that his
daughters were sufficiently “undutiful and unkind”—as
Milton styled it—to leave him some years before his death.
That the possessor of the same virile intellect which penned
the “Areopagitica,” with its brave freedom, could tolerate
and promulgate the servitude and degradation of one half of
humanity indicates in him a mental darkness as gross and
as pitiable as his physical blindness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hitherto the world has been governed by brute force
only, which means that the stronger animal, man, has kept
the weaker in subjection, allowing her to live only in so far
as she ministered to his comforts; that he has not unnaturally
made laws and fixed customs to suit his own
pleasure and convenience, always at the expense of the
woman; and, what is worse, that he has in all countries
given a religious sanction to his vices, in order to bend the
woman to his wishes.... I might also add that all
cruel customs relating to woman have been imposed upon
her under the guise of religion, and hence, though so injurious
and baneful to herself, she is even slower to change
them than the man. There is hardly any cruel wrong
which has been inflicted in the course of ages by man upon
his fellow-man that has not been justified by an appeal to
religion.”—Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (“Address to the

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... A. Dumas fils speaks of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“les femmes,
ces éternelles mineures des religions et des codes;” and of
“les arguments à l’aide desquels l’Eglise veut mettre les
femmes de son côté”; and shows as the effect that “Il y a
des femmes honnêtes, esclaves du devoir, pieuses. Leur
religion leur a enseigné le sacrifice. Non seulement elles
ne se plaignent pas des épreuves à traverser mais elles les
appellent pour mériter encore plus la récompense promise,
et elles les bénissent quand elles viennent. Tout arrive,
pour elles, par la volonté de Dieu, et tout est comme il doit
être dans cette vallée des larmes, chemin de l’éternité
bienheureuse.... D’ailleurs elles ne lisent ni les
journaux, ni les livres où il est question de ces choses-là;
cette lecture leur est interdite. Si, par hasard, elles avaient
connaissance de pareilles idées,&#160;... elles en rougiraient,
elles en souffriraient pour leur sexe, et elles prieraient
pour celles qui se laissent aller à propager de si dangereuses
erreurs et à donner de si déplorables exemples....
Mais, pas plus que le bonheur, la ruse, l’ignorance, la
misère et la servitude, la foi aveugle, l’extase, et l’immobilité
volontaire de l’esprit ne sont des arguments sans
réplique.”—(“Les Femmes qui Tuent,” &amp;c., pp. 10, 91,
103.)</span></p>

<p class='c011'>The evil which Dumas points out is common to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>religions, of whatever race or make; the hall-mark of every
creed, from Confucianism to Comtism, has been the subjection
of woman, under the affectation of advocating her
highest interests. The pious compound has usually been
altered to meet the growing intellectual requirements of
common-sense and justice and humanity, and hence the
precepts of religion as to feminine conduct have by no
means always lain in such lines as the multitude in our modern
Western civilisation still enjoins on women. No more
than the whole and universal attitude of religion, ancient or
modern, as regards woman, is exposed or expressed in the
following recapitulation of present or historic facts:—“It is
not the chastity of women, as we understand it, but her subjection,
that Japanese morality requires. The woman is a
thing possessed, and her immorality consists simply in disposing
freely of herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As regards prostitution, Brahmanic India is scarcely
more scrupulous than Japan, and there again we find
religious prostitution practised in the temples, analogous to
that which in ancient Greece was practised at Cyprus,
Corinth, Miletus, Tenedos, Lesbos, Abydos, &amp;c. (Lecky,
‘History of European Morals,’ Vol. I., p. 103). According
to the legend, the Buddha himself, Sakyamouni, when
visiting the famous Indian town of Vasali, was received
there by the great mistress of the courtesans. (Mrs. Spier,
‘Life in Ancient India,’ p. 28).”—Letourneau (“The
Evolution of Marriage,” Chap. X.).</p>

<p class='c011'>The enforcement, or commendation, or acceptance of
the practice of prostitution, with its profanation of the
dignity and individuality of woman, and its utter carelessness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and disregard for either her physical or intellectual
well-being, is indubitable evidence of the man-made (<em>i.e.</em>,
male) origin of such a scheme of religion or ethics or
economics. For, as Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham truly remarks:—“If
a doubt yet remains on the mind of any reader that I
have stated truly the part of the masculine as cause in this
terrible phenomenon, let it be considered how man has always
introduced prostitution in every country that he has visited,
and every island of the sea. Does anyone believe, for example,
that if the voyages of discovery and trade had been made by
women instead of men, to the islands of the Pacific, this
scourge would have been left as the testimony of their visit,
so that, in a few generations, the populations native there
would have fallen a literal sacrifice to their sensuality, as
they are actually falling to man’s at this day? There is no
comment needed on the illustration, I am sure. The common
sense of every reader will furnish the best comment
and answer the question correctly.”—(“Woman and Her
Era,” Vol. II., p. 299.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Lastly, but most convincingly, as to the wilful
and intentional degradation and subjugation of woman by
the teaching and rites of religion, let it be noted that, among
the Jews, the very fact of being a woman is made a disgrace;
and woman, the mother of the human race, is
insulted accordingly. In the morning synagogue service
of prayer, directly after unitedly blessing “Adonai,” for
bestowing on the barn-door fowl the power to distinguish
between night and day, and for not having created the
worshippers present heathens or slaves, each member of
the male portion of the congregation thanks the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Adonai “that Thou hast not fashioned me as a woman,”
while each member of the segregated female portion of the
company is instructed to submissively give thanks “that
Thou hast fashioned me after Thine own pleasure.” The
male thanks for not being heathens seem, under the circumstances,
conspicuously premature.—(See “Ohel Jakob,”
<em>i.e.</em>, “Jacob’s Temple,” the “Daily Prayer of the Israelites,”
Fraenkel’s ed., Berlin.)</p>

<p class='c011'>That the spirit of this Mosaic or Hebrew sexual teaching,
with its incongruous assertions and inferences, has communicated
itself deeply to Christianity, may be observed
from such passages as 1 Tim. ii. 13, 14; 1 Cor. vii., 9;
Eph. v. 24; Col. iii. 18; 1 Pet. iii. 1, 5; and many others.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Buckle quotes from “Fergusson on the
Epistles,” 1656, p. 242:—“The great and main duty which
a wife, as a wife, ought to learn, and so learn as to practice
it, is to be subject to her own husband.” (See also Note
XVII., 8.) And Buckle further cites, from “Fox’s Journal,”
“After the middle of the seventeenth century the Quakers
set up ‘women’s’ meetings, to the disgust of many, and
(query, because) in the teeth of St. Paul’s opinion.”—(“Miscellaneous
and Posthumous Works,” Vol. I., pp. 375,
384.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... As already said, the “sanctimonious” claim
of “woman’s duty” runs through all religions. Here, for
instance, is what is reported in a leader of the <em>Manchester
Guardian</em> of August 15th, 1892:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“In this country no one would place suicide in the ranks of
the virtues. Here it is a crime, but in China under certain circumstances
it is regarded as an act of heroism and devotion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>worthy of sympathy and of national recognition. Thus the
Governor of Shansi forwarded to the Emperor of China a
memorial setting forth the virtues as daughter and wife of a lady
in that province. She was of good family, both her father and
grandfather having been officials in the district. At the age of
ten she showed her love for her mother in a peculiarly Chinese
fashion. One of the Celestial beliefs is that medicine acquires
efficacy by having mingled with it some human flesh, and the
little girl cut some from her own body to be used for the purpose
of curing an illness which threatened her mother’s life. In 1890
she was married to an ‘expectant magistrate,’ whose expectations
were realised by his appointment last autumn to a judicial
post. What she had, as a good daughter, done for her mother,
she, as a good wife, did also for her husband, who fell ill; but
her remedy was inefficacious, and he died. She was now in a
position which, according to the Chinese code of ethics, has no
responsibilities for a woman. Without parents, husband, or
children to demand her affectionate care, she decided to commit
suicide, and apparently not only communicated her intentions to
those around her, but had their sympathy and support in her
decision. We are told that, “only waiting till she had completed
the arrangements for her husband’s interment, she swallowed
gold and powder of lead. She handed her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</span></i> to her
relations to defray her funeral expenses, and made presents
to the younger members of the family and the servants, after
which, draped in her state robes, she sat waiting her end. The
poison began to work, and soon all was over.” The story of a
distracted wife seeking refuge in death from the sorrows of
widowhood might doubtless be told of any country in Europe,
but the sequel is possible only in China. The Governor of
Shansi, struck with the courage of the lady in what he evidently
regards as a very proper though somewhat unusual exhibition
of conjugal affection, asks in his memorial that the virtuous life
and death of the lady may be duly commemorated. The prayer
of the memorial has been granted by the Emperor and a
memorial arch is to be erected in honour of the suicide.”</p>

      <div class='line'>6.—“... <em>civil law</em>&#160;...”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>For example of this let us look at the law of our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>country in even recent times. Blackstone says:—“The
husband (by the old law) might give his wife moderate correction....
But this power of correction was confined
within reasonable bounds, and the husband was
prohibited from using any violence to his wife, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliter quam
ad virum ex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suæ licite
et rationabiliter pertinet</span></i> (<em>i.e.</em>, otherwise than to a man for
the ruling and punishment of his wife, lawfully and reasonably
pertains). The civil law gave the husband the same
or a larger authority over his wife, allowing him for some
misdemeanours, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem</span></i>
(<em>i.e.</em>, to severely beat his wife with whips and cudgels), for
others, only <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modicam castigationem adhibere</span></i> (to administer a
moderate chastisement). But with us, in the politer reign of
Charles the Second, this power of correction began to be
doubted, and a wife may now (<em>circ.</em> 1750) have security
of peace against her husband; or in return, a husband
against his wife. Yet the lower rank of people, who were
always fond of the old common law,” (query, were the
women fond of it?) “still claim and exert their ancient
privilege: and the courts of law will still permit a husband
to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of any gross misbehaviour.”
(“Commentaries,” Edward Christian’s Ed.,
Book I., Chap. XV.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was undoubtedly the generally accepted and not
infrequently acted upon assumption; and it is certain that
the Courts of Law would, in the event of a wife absenting
herself from her husband, order her return to his custody;
and would, and did imprison her in default of her compliance.
And this state of things continued until—as Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Wolstenholme Elmy records in her history of the celebrated
“Clitheroe case”—</p>

<p class='c004'>“At length, in the year 1891, and, as in the case of the negro
Somerset, upon the return to a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>, there
have been found judges bold enough and just enough to set
aside the ancient saws and maxims, resting mainly upon <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter
dicta</span></i> and loose phrases of previous judges used in reference to
hypothetical cases never actually before the Courts, and to
declare plainly and straightly that the personal slavery of the
wife is no part of the law of England. The actual words of the
Lord Chancellor in dealing with the return to the writ are, as
reported by the <cite>Times</cite>, March 20th, 1891, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“After stating the circumstances of the marriage, the decree,
and the refusal of the wife to cohabit, it states: ‘I therefore
took my wife, and have since detained her in my house, using
no more force or restraint than necessary to take her and keep
her.’ That is the return which seeks to justify an admitted imprisonment
of this lady. I do not know that I am able to
express in sufficiently precise language the difference between
‘confinement’ and ‘imprisonment,’ but if there is any distinction,
I can only say that upon these facts I should find an imprisonment,
and looking at the return it is put as a broad proposition
that the right of the husband, where there has been a wilful
absenting of herself by the wife from her husband’s house—that
it is his right to seize possession of his wife by force, and detain
her in his house until she renders him conjugal rights. That is
the proposition of law involved in the return, and I am not prepared
to assent to it. The Legislature has expressly deprived
the Matrimonial Court of the power of imprisoning the wife for
refusal to comply with a decree for restitution of conjugal rights,
and the result of such a system of law, if the husband had the
power, would be that whereas the Court had no power to hand
the wife over into her husband’s hands, but only to punish her
for contempt by imprisonment under the control of the Court,
and without any circumstances of injury or insult, and even
that power was taken away, the husband might himself of his
own motion seize and imprison her until she consented to the
restitution of conjugal rights. That is the proposition I am
called upon to establish by holding this return to be good.
<em>I am of opinion that no such right or power exists in law. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of opinion that no such right ever did exist in our law.</em> Whatever
authorities may be quoted for any such proposition, it has
always been subject to this condition: that where she has a complaint
of, or is apprehensive of, ill-usage, the Court will never interfere
to compel her to return to her husband’s custody. Now this
brings me to the particular circumstances of this transaction. I
am prepared to say that no English subject has a right to imprison
another English subject (who is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</span></i>, and entitled to
a judgment of his or her own) without any lawful authority, but
if there were any qualification of that proposition I should be of
opinion that on the facts of this case it would afford an ample
justification to any Court for refusing to allow the husband in
this case to retain the custody of his wife.</p>

<p class='c004'>“On these and other grounds the Lord Chancellor declared
that the return of the writ was bad, and ordered that the lady
be restored to her liberty, the other judges concurring.”—(“The
Decision in the Clitheroe Case and its Consequences,”
pp. 3, 4.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Esher was one of the two other Judges, both
concurring, who formed the Court of Appeal which granted
the writ, and a few days subsequently he gave from his place
in the House of Lords the following further statement of
his judgment and views:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“As I was a party to the judgment, which seems to have
been more misunderstood than any judgment I recollect, I,
perhaps, may be excused from making an observation. It was
urged before the Court of Appeal that by the law of England a
husband may beat his wife with a stick if she refuses to obey
him, and that if a wife refused her husband conjugal rights,
whatever that phrase may mean, which I have never been able
to make out, he may imprison her until she restores him conjugal
rights, or satisfies him that she will. All that the Court
of Appeal decided was that a husband cannot by the law of
England, if the wife objects, lawfully do either of those things.
Those intelligent people who have declared that the judgment
is wrong must be prepared to maintain the converse—namely,
that if a wife disobeys her husband he may lawfully beat her;
and if she refuses him a restitution of conjugal rights he may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>imprison her, it was urged, in the cellar, or in the cupboard, or,
if the house is large, in the house, by locking her in it and
blocking the windows. I thought, and still think, that the law
does not allow these things....”—(The <cite>Times</cite>, 17th April,
1891.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy further tells us that:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“To Lord Selborne the married women of this country owe
a further debt of gratitude for his introduction in 1884 of the
Matrimonial Causes Act of that session, which put an end to
the punishment by imprisonment of the husband or wife who
refused to obey the decree of the Court for restitution of conjugal
rights. The arguments of Mr. Lankester and Mr. Finlay
in the Clitheroe case, based upon this abolition of the power of
the Court to imprison for disobedience, are known to everyone.
It would be destructive not only to personal freedom, but a
gross infraction of justice and common-sense, were a husband
to be permitted to exercise on his own behalf and at his own
pleasure a prerogative of punishment which had been withdrawn
from the Court.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That this power of imprisonment was not a mere <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">brutum
fulmen</span></i>, but a terrible reality in former days, may be learned
from a Suffolk case, early in the present century. A wife in
contempt of court, a lady of good family in Suffolk, was imprisoned
in Ipswich goal for disobeying a decree requiring her
to render conjugal rights to her husband. At the end of a
year and ten months she became in want of the common
necessaries of life, and was reduced to the gaol allowance of
bread and water; she suffered from rheumatism and other
maladies, which were aggravated by the miseries of her imprisonment;
and after many years of such suffering died in
prison—for she never went back to her husband.”—(“The
Decision in the Clitheroe Case and its Consequences,” p. 9.)</p>

<p class='c011'>But while the law has thus been needfully amended in
England, a further evil effect has meantime supervened in
our dependency of India; for this faculty of imprisonment
by the Courts for non-compliance with their order in the
event specified, which has been abolished in England, seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to be still existent and appealed to in our Indian Courts.
(See Note XXII., 2.) The strange thing is that the suit
for the restitution of conjugal rights is not a matter of native
law, but an inadvertent and apparently entirely unintentional
introduction from our English system; the very
judges who administer the Indian Law being at a loss to
account for its appearance in their practice. One authority,
in seeking the solution of the problem, declares that—“Mr. ——
‘could not find any enactment directly establishing
suits for the restitution of conjugal rights, and
believed there were none; but that they had been recognised
in a Stamp Act, and again in the Limitation of Suits
Act passed in 1871.’ The material point is that Indian
lawgivers have not consciously given this remedy to those
who did not possess it before; but that it has slipped into
our law without design. Mr. —— thinks ‘That this class of
suits was known in the old Supreme Courts, in the Presidency
towns, and as between Europeans; and it was not
an improper subject of legislation as regards Stamp Duty
or Limitation by Time: but being spoken of without qualification
was held by the High Courts to be available for all
classes of the Indian communities.’ If this theory be true,
it accounts in an easy way for a change effected without
any intention of the Rulers at all. It is worth enquiry into
under this aspect.” Yes, enquiry and rectification hand in
hand!</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>—“... <em>and part divine</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact has been that male lawgivers, in whatever land,
have generally asserted for their code of feminine ethics or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>conduct a divine origin, and have announced the punishment
for breach thereof as a divine injunction. In very
few instances, indeed, was there any attempt to decree an
equal punishment to the male who was partner with the
female in a mutual breach of this morality, and very frequently
no punishment of the male attached at all; and
even in the few cases where such a punishment was nominally
threatened, the man’s share in the offence was most generally
connived at, and passed unpunished. This double code
of morality has a flagrant exemplification in the English
Law of Divorce, by which, while a man can procure a
Decree of Divorce on the simple ground of the adultery of
his wife, a woman cannot obtain a like decree for her
husband’s adultery unless that offence be accompanied by
such treatment of herself as the Court will recognise as
“cruelty,” or with “desertion.” The double scheme of
sexual morality, so revoltingly tolerated, in so far as man is
concerned, by “society” in the present day is too patent
to need further words here. And the repulsive cant is still
that, while the man is allowed to go free, the punishment of
the woman is due and commendable as in accordance with
“divine law.” (See Note XIV., 3.)</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“... husband and wife; or, as most of our elder
law books call them, ‘baron’ and ‘feme.’”—(Blackstone’s
“Commentaries,” Bk. I. Chap. 15.)</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>But the context of the words “baron” and “feme” involved
something more than a mere <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façon de parler</span></i> of the
law books. Edward Christian says, in Note 23 to the
Chapter in “Blackstone” above quoted:—“Husband and
wife, in the language of the law, are styled <em>baron</em> and <i><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">feme</span></i>;
the word baron, or lord, attributes to the husband not a
very courteous superiority. But we might be inclined to
think this merely an unmeaning technical phrase, if we did
not recollect, that if the baron kills his feme it is the same
as if he had killed a stranger or any other person; but if
the feme kills her baron it is regarded by the laws as a much
more atrocious crime, as she not only breaks through the
restraints of humanity and conjugal affection, but throws
off all subjection to the authority of her husband. And,
therefore, the law denominates her crime a species of
treason, and condemns her to the same punishment as if
she had killed the king. And for every species of treason
(though in petit treason the punishment of men was only to
be drawn and hanged), till the 30 Geo. III., Chap. 48, the
sentence of woman was to be drawn and burnt alive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Courtney Kenny says, on the same point, that
the English Law of Marriage in the twelfth century had
“clothed the humblest husband with more than the authority
of a feudal lord, and merged his wife’s legal existence altogether
in his own.”—(“History of the Law of Married
Women’s Property,” p. 8.)</p>

<p class='c011'>And he exemplifies the position of the “feme” as being

<p class='c011'>By a leading article on Woman Suffrage, in the <cite>Times</cite> of
29th April, 1892, a clear light is thrown on the causes which
largely influenced the extension of the Parliamentary franchise
to the poorer class of male citizens,—“a share of
political power which they are not particularly well fitted to
use,” says the <cite>Times</cite>;—and which denied the same right of
franchise to women of whatever class. The intellect of the
<cite>Times</cite> enounces that—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Without desiring to disparage the sex in any way, we must
venture to maintain that in both camps a large female contingent
would be a mischievous element. The female Conservative
politician would be an obstacle to all rational reform;
the female Liberal politician would be the advocate of every
crude and febrile innovation. No doubt we have put plausible
arguments in the mouths of mere logic-choppers by treating
the franchise as a right rather than as a privilege and a trust.
Men can demand a share of <em>political power which they are not
particularly well fitted to use</em>, because they possess <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> a
share of the physical force upon which all political arrangements
ultimately repose. Women do not possess such physical
force, and, therefore, can prefer no such claim.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing over, as unworthy of serious refutation, the wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>assertions due to sex-bias in the first part of the above
extract, it may be noted how instantly the lauded masculine
weapon of logic is discarded and contemned as soon as it
points in the direction of equal justice for woman. The
“physical force” question is further dealt with in Note
XLV., 6. But considering the words we have italicised,
does not the whole of the <cite>Times</cite> exposition as above justify
the appellation of cowardly “fear”? (See also p. 78.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Yet an even more unworthy thing than
denial of the suffrage has taken place, in that English
women have been really robbed of their earlier franchises.
A lady Poor Law Guardian of the Tewkesbury Union has
written:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“... the present position of women in regard to the
various franchises is anomalous and contradictory, unworthy of
that great growth of freedom which the nineteenth century has
given to men, and degenerate as regards the position which
women held in the days of the Plantagenets and the Tudors.
Freedom for women has not broadened down ‘from precedent
to precedent.’ Rather has it suffered by unnecessary legislative
interference. Every woman, except the Queen, is, politically,
non-existent. It was not always so. Restrictions unknown to
our ancient constitution have crept in.... Chief Justice
Lee is reported to have cited a case (in a manuscript collection
of Hakewell’s), Catherine <em>v.</em> Surrey, in which it was
expressly decided, that a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feme sole</span></i>, if she has a freehold, may
vote for members of Parliament; and a further one (from the
same collection), Holt <em>v.</em> Lyle, in which it was decided, that a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feme sole</span></i> householder may claim a voice for Parliament men;
but, if married, her husband must vote for her; whilst Justice
Page declared, ‘I see no disability in a woman from voting for
a Parliament man.’ So closely, in the minds of our Judges,
were the local and Parliamentary franchises bound up, that a
question as to the rights of women in local voting seemed to
involve considerations as to their right to vote for Parliament
men.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Yet, even in the matter of these local franchises, women have
suffered, and do suffer, from legislative tinkering and sex-biassed
decisions in our law courts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Down to 1835, women, possessing the qualifications which
entitled men to vote, voted freely in municipal elections, and in
some important cities, such as London and Edinburgh, the
civic rights even of married women, possessing a separate
qualification from the husband, were well established. The
Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, however (passed by the
Whig administration of Lord Melbourne), was framed upon the
evil precedent of the Reform Act of 1832, and by the use of
the words ‘male persons,’ in treating of the franchises under it,
disfranchised every woman in the boroughs to which it applied,
and this disfranchisement lasted for thirty-four years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nevertheless, in non-corporate districts, women continued to
vote as freely as before, and thus secured the ultimate restitution
of the rights of their disfranchised sisters in incorporated
districts; for, when in 1869, on the consideration of the
Municipal Franchise Bill of that year, these peculiar facts were
brought to the notice of the House of Commons, and it was
shown that the incorporation of any district involved the
summary disfranchisement of the women ratepayers, the House,
without a dissentient word, or any shadow of opposition,
adopted the proposal to omit the word ‘male’ before the word
‘person’ in Section 1 of the Bill, and thus restored the rights
of the women ratepayers, of whom many thousands voted, as a
consequence of the passing of the Act, in the municipal
elections of the following November.”—Mrs. Harriett McIlquham

Modern Need,” pp. 5, 12, 13.)</p>

has been delayed by legal difficulties, but the Attorney
General has now submitted to the Court of Chancery a first
list of awards. Details given in the <cite>Journal of Education</cite>
show that Girton and Newnham Colleges receive £5,000 each,
whilst Bedford College, Somerville Hall, the New Hospital
for Women, the Maria Grey Training College, and a number of
other institutions benefit by slightly smaller sums. The bequests
will doubtless be welcomed by the recipients, for all the
institutions included so far are doing useful work with very
inadequate means, and it is to be hoped that the generous
example of the London merchant and his literary wife will be
often followed in the future. Women’s education—and girls’,
too, for that matter—in this country is almost unendowed, and
is yet expected to produce results equal to those gained in the
richly endowed foundations for boys and men. The interest of
the Pfeiffer bequest, however, lies rather in the spirit that
prompted it and in the views of progress held by the donors
than in the generosity of the gift or the precise manner of its
distribution. In a letter explaining his wishes, Mr. Pfeiffer
remarks:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have always had and am adhering to the idea of
leaving the bulk of my property in England for charitable
and educational purposes in favour of women. Theirs is,
to my mind, the great influence of the future. Education
and culture and responsibility in more than one direction,
including that of politics, will gradually fit them for the
exercise of every power that could possibly work towards
the regeneration of mankind. It is women who have hitherto
had the worst of life, but their interest, and with their
interest that of humanity, is secured, and I therefore am
determined to help them to the best of my ability and
means.”—<cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>, June 7th, 1892.</p>

chemical discovery from that jobber. Ask the digger in the
ditch to explain Newton’s laws; the fine organs of his brain
have been pinched by overwork and squalid poverty from
father to son, for a hundred years. When each comes forth
from his mother’s womb, the gate of gifts closes behind
him. Let him value his hands and feet, he has but one

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “The British <em>race</em> cannot afford to dispense
with <em>all</em> the advantage that may be in embryo in the future
female intellect, because men and some women are found
who declare that women are intellectually inferior....
No amount of prayers and wishes and submitting to God’s
will are of any avail. You must <em>use</em> the organs of the intellect
in order, not only to increase their efficiency, but
to prevent their going from bad to worse. It might here
be noted, that because the British people might choose to
be satisfied with atrophy of the intellect lobes in their
mothers, it will not at all follow that other nations will
do so <em>also</em>. If such things as nations exist, there will
always be rivalry and competition, and depend upon it
those will be first whose mothers generally possess the
most efficient intellect lobes.... Fortunately we
have learnt another great lesson, evolved by Charles Darwin’s
frontal lobes, and that is, that there is no such thing
as a <em>fixed</em> and <em>unalterable</em> tissue or organism anywhere. All
organisms and parts of organisms are <em>changeable</em>. Everything—organ
and organism—<em>has</em> changed in the past, <em>is</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>changing in the present, and <em>will</em> change in the future in
accordance with the conditions that surround it. Women’s
frontal lobes and grey matter will certainly be no exception
to the rule. Emancipation, keeping her eyes open, and
thinking for herself are the three main things she has to
keep hammering at, until the lords of creation <em>see</em> that
they are the right things to do, to save future generations
from universal imbecility.”—E. Bonavia, M.D. (“Woman’s

<p class='c011'>“We find a good example in the United States, where, to
the horror of learned and unlearned pedants of both sexes,
numerous colleges exist in which large numbers of young
men and women are educated together. And with what
results? President White, of the University of Michigan,
expresses himself thus: ‘For some years past a young
woman has been the best scholar of the Greek language
among 1,300 students; the best student in mathematics in
one of the classes of our institution is a young woman, and
many of the best scholars in natural and general science
are also young women.’ Dr. Fairchild, President of
Oberlin College in Ohio, in which over 1,000 students of
both sexes study in mixed classes, says: ‘During an experience
of eight years as Professor of the ancient languages,
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and in the branches of ethics
and philosophy, and during an experience of eleven years
in theoretical and applied mathematics, the only difference
which I have observed between the sexes was in the
manner of their rhetoric.’ Edward H. Machill, President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, tells us that an experience
of four years has forced him to the conclusion
that the education of both sexes in common leads to the
best moral results. This may be mentioned in passing as
a reply to those who imagine such an education must
endanger morality.”—Bebel (“Women,” Walther’s Translation,
p. 131). (See also Notes to line 7, forward.)</p>

<p class='c011'>It is of good omen that the precedent thus set in America
is finding a following in our own isle also. All honour to

newspapers of 15th March, 1892, relate that: “The
Senatus Academicus of the University of St. Andrews has
agreed to open its classes in arts, science, and theology to
women, who will be taught along with men. The University
will receive next year a sum of over £30,000 to be
spent on bursaries, one half of the sum to be devoted to
women exclusively. Steps are being taken to secure a hall
of residence in which the women students may live while
attending the University classes.”</p>

a grasp of the general character of science, and without
having been disciplined more or less in the methods of all
sciences; so that when turned into the world to make their
own way, they shall be prepared to face scientific problems,
not by knowing at once the conditions of every problem, or
by being able at once to solve it, but by being familiar with
the general current of scientific thought, and by being able
to apply the methods of science in the proper way, when

<p class='c011'>And the same learned professor tells us, on another
occasion:—“A liberal education is an artificial education
which has not only prepared a man to escape the great
evils of disobedience to natural laws, but has trained him
to appreciate and to seize upon the rewards which Nature
scatters with as free a hand as her penalties. That man, I
think,” (shall we not include “woman” also, on his own
showing as above?) “has had a liberal education who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>been so trained in youth that his body is the ready servant
of his will, and does with ease and pleasure all the work
that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect is a
clear, cold logic engine, with all its parts in equal strength
and in smooth working order, ready, like a steam engine, to
be turned to every kind of work, and spin the gossamers
as well as forge the anchors of the mind; whose mind is
stored with a knowledge of the great and fundamental
truths of Nature, and of the laws of her operations; one
who, no stunted ascetic, is full of life and fire, but whose
passions are trained to come to heel by a vigorous will, the
servant of a tender conscience; who has learned to love all
beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to hate all vileness, and
to respect others as himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such an one, and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal
education, for he is as completely as a man can be in
harmony with Nature. He will make the best of her, and
she of him. They will get on together rarely; she as his
ever beneficent mother, he as her mouthpiece, her conscious

<p class='c011'>How largely strength is simply a matter of training may
be instanced by a case or two:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The results of practice and training from childhood on
the bodily development can be seen in female acrobats and
circus riders, who could compete with any man in courage,
daring, dexterity, and strength, and whose performances
are frequently astonishing.”—Bebel (“Woman,” p. 126).</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“I am a medical man. I have spent several years in
Africa, and have seen human nature among tribes whose
habits are utterly unlike those of Europe. I had been
accustomed to believe that the <em>muscular</em> system of women
is necessarily feebler than that of men, and perhaps I
might have dogmatised to that effect; but, to my astonishment,
I found the African women to be as strong as our
men.... Not only did I see the proof of it in their
work and in the weights which they lifted, but on examining
their arms I found them large and hard beyond all my
previous experience. On the contrary, I saw the men of
these tribes to be weak, their muscles small and flabby.
Both facts are accounted for by the habits of the people.
The men are lazy in the extreme; all the hard work is
done by the women.”—(<cite>Westminster Review</cite>, Oct., 1865,

spirit for over an hour, included the Duchess of Westminster,

<p class='c011'>Later on in the year we read in the journal <cite>Woman</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the Marlow Regatta an extremely pretty girl in navy
serge, built Eton fashion, was a Miss ——, who wore as an
under-bodice a full vest of shaded yellow Indian silk. Her
prowess with the oar is the cause of daily admiration to the
Marlowites.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, on August 15th, 1892, the <cite>Manchester Evening
Mail</cite> has the following:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“An ailing ‘navvy,’ who has been engaged in some works
near Versailles, was a few days ago admitted to a hospital in
that town. Before the sick person had long been in the institution
it was discovered that the apparent ‘navvy’ was a woman.
The superintendent of the hospital was not in the least surprised
on hearing of the transformation scene, for it appears that he is
accustomed to deal with many woman patients who enter the
hospital in male attire. It is common in the district (says a
Paris correspondent) for robust women to don men’s garb in
order to obtain remunerative employment as navvies, porters,
farm labourers, road menders, or assistants to bricklayers,
masons, and builders. It has long been established that the
average Frenchwoman of town or country has as great a
capacity for work either in counting-houses, shops, fields, or
farms as her lord and master has for laziness and lolling in the
cafés, playing dominoes, and smoking cigarettes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the preceding day, August 14th, 1892, the St. Petersburg
journals reported that:—</p>

<p class='c011'>And, in October, 1892, the “sporting” newspapers recorded
that:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Women are gradually coming to the fore as bicycle riders.
Miss Dudley, a well-known rider, has just accomplished a feat
which would have seemed wonderful for any rider not long ago.
She has ridden from a spot near Hitchin to Lincoln, a distance
of 100 miles, in little more than seven hours, or at the average
speed of about fourteen miles an hour. Mr. and Mrs. Smith
are well-known as tandem riders, and they have won many
races together; but this is, perhaps, the first recorded instance
of a woman cyclist holding her own so well, unaided, in a long

<p class='c011'>“There is a problem creeping gradually forward upon
us, a problem that will have to be solved in time, and that
is the steady increase of population.... I believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>that with the emancipation of women we shall solve this
problem now. Fewer children will be born, and those that
are born will be of a higher and better physique than the
present order of men. The ghastly abortions, which in
many parts pass muster nowadays, owing to the unnatural
physical conditions of society, as men, women, and children,
will make room for a nobler and higher order of beings,
who will come to look upon the production of mankind in
a diseased or degraded state as a wickedness and unpardonable
crime, against which all men and women should fight
and strive.”—Lady Florence Dixie (“Gloriana,” p. 137).</p>

rebellion against the madness of large families, it would
confer a priceless benefit on humanity.”—(<cite>Nineteenth

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “To bring a child into existence without a
fair prospect of being able, not only to provide food for its
body, but instruction and training for its mind, is a moral
crime, both against the unfortunate offspring and against
society.... The fact itself of causing the existence of
a human being, is one of the most responsible actions
in the range of human life. To undertake this responsibility—to
bestow a life which may be either a curse or a
blessing—unless the being on whom it is bestowed will have
at least the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a
crime against that being. And in a country either over-peopled,
or threatened with being so, to produce children,
beyond a very small number, with the effect of reducing the
reward of labour by their competition, is a serious offence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>against all who live by the remuneration of their labour.”—J.
S. Mill (“Liberty,” Chap. V.).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... A. Dumas fils draws a true and piteous
picture in which this element of the unintelligent overproduction
of human beings has the largest share:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il y a, et c’est la masse, les femmes du peuple et de la
campagne suant du matin au soir pour gagner le pain
quotidien, faisant ainsi ce que faisaient leurs mères, et mettant
au monde, sans savoir pourquoi ni comment, des filles
qui, à leur tour, feront comme elles, à moins que, plus jolies,
et par conséquent plus insoumises, elles ne sortent du
groupe par le chemin tentant et facile de la prostitution,
mais où le labeur est encore plus rude. Le dos courbé sous
le travail du jour, regardant la terre quand elles marchent,
domptées par la misère, vaincues par l’habitude, asservies
aux besoins des autres, ces créatures à forme de femme ne
supposent que leur condition puisse être modifiée jamais.
Elles n’ont pas le temps, elles n’ont jamais eu la faculté de
penser et de réfléchir; à peine un souhait vague et bientôt
refoulé de quelque chose de mieux! Quand la charge est
trop lourde elles tombent, elles geignent comme des
animaux terrassés, elles versent de grosses larmes à l’idée de
laisser leurs petits sans ressources, ou elles remercient instinctivement
la mort, c’est-à-dire le repos dont elles ont tant
besoin.” (“Les Femmes qui Tuent,” etc., p. 101.)</span></p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... And again, the advanced biological writers
say:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The statistician will doubtless long continue his fashion
of confidently estimating the importance and predicting the
survival of populations from their quantity and rate of reproduction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>alone; but at all this, as naturalists, we can only
scoff. Even the most conventional exponent of the struggle
for existence among us knows, with the barbarian conquerors
of old, that ‘the thicker the grass, the easier it is
mown,’ that ‘the wolf cares not how many the sheep may
be.’ It is the most individuated type that prevails in spite,
nay, in another sense, positively because of its slower increase;
in a word, the survival of a species or family depends
not primarily upon quantity, but upon quality. The future
is not to the most numerous population, but to the most
individuated....</p>

<p class='c011'>“Apart from the pressure of population, it is time to be
learning (1) That the annual child-bearing still so common,
is cruelly exhaustive to the maternal life, and this often in
actual duration as well as quality; (2) That it is similarly
injurious to the standard of offspring; and hence, (3) That
an interval of two clear years between births (some gynæcologists
even go as far as three) is due alike to mother and
offspring.” (It is to be noted that this period of three years
is postulated as a necessity for the well-being of the offspring;
it is by no means a recommendation to even a
triennial maternity on the part of the mother, who is indeed
to be, in all fulness, “free mistress of her person’s sacred
plan,” with a duty to herself, as well as to her child).
“It is time, therefore, as we heard a brave parson tell his
flock lately, ‘to have done with that blasphemous whining
which constantly tries to look at a motherless’ (ay, or
sometimes even fatherless) ‘crowd of puny infants as a
dispensation of mysterious providence.’ Let us frankly face
the biological facts, and admit that such cases usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>illustrate only the extreme organic nemesis of intemperance
and improvidence, and these of a kind far more reprehensible
than those actions to which common custom applies the
names, since they are species-regarding vices, and not
merely self-regarding ones, as the others at least primarily
are....</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems to us, however, essential to recognise that
the ideal to be sought after is not merely a controlled rate
of increase, but regulated married lives.... We
would urge, in fact, the necessity of an ethical rather than of
a mechanical ‘prudence after marriage,’ of a temperance
recognised to be as binding on husband and wife as chastity
on the unmarried.... Just as we would protest
against the dictum of false physicians who preach indulgence
rather than restraint, so we must protest against
regarding artificial means of preventing fertilisation as
adequate solutions of sexual responsibility. After all, the
solution is primarily one of temperance. It is no new nor
unattainable ideal to retain, throughout married life, a large
measure of that self-control which must always form the
organic basis of the enthusiasm and idealism of lovers.”—Geddes
and Thomson (“The Evolution of Sex,” Chap. XX.).</p>

<p class='c004'>As a fitting exemplification of the words of the “parson”
above narrated, compare the following verbatim extract from a
conversation in this year of grace 1892. The —— referred to
is a man about 35, middle-class, and of “good ‘education’” (!)
The same description would also apply to the speaker, who
said, “Poor —— is a brave fellow, and keeps up his head in the
worst of luck. He has a lot of home troubles; he has lost
three children, and his wife always has a bad time at the birth
of each baby.”</p>

<p class='c004'>No word of sympathy for the wife and mother, or even of
recognition that it was really <em>she</em> who bore the pain at each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“bad time.” As the children left alive still numbered two at
the time of the speech, the whole incident can but imply—on
the part of both actor and speaker—the hideous, even if unconscious,
inhumanity so widely prevalent. Never will “high-born
breed” be attained till such action of low-bred intellect is
reprobated and amended; in accordance with the enunciated
truth, that:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Especially in higher organisms, a distinction must obviously
be drawn between the period at which it is possible
for males and females to unite in fertile sexual union, and
the period at which such union will naturally occur or will
result in the fittest offspring.”—Geddes and Thomson (<em>op.
cit.</em>, p. 243).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “<em>Justice never loses sight of self.</em>...
The language of Justice is ‘to Me and to You; or to You
and to Me.’&#160;... We have to learn, for the action
and spirit worthy of the coming time, that woman is never
to sacrifice herself to a man, but, when needful, to the
<em>Manhood</em> she hopes or desires to develop in him. In this
she will also attain her own development. But after the hour
when her faith in the hope of worthy results fails her (reason
instructing her nobler affections by holding candidly in
view all the premises, past, present, and future), she is
bound by all her higher obligations to bring that career,
whether it be of the daughter, sister, mother, wife, or friend,
to a close. For the inferior cannot possibly be worth the
sacrifice of the superior. True self-sacrifice, which necessarily
involves the temporary descent of the nobler to the
less noble—the higher to the lower—is made only when
the lower is elevated, improved, carried forward in its
career, thereby.”—Eliza W. Farnham (“Woman and Her
Era,” Vol. II., p. 149).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... “I have urged on woman independence of
man, not that I do not think the sexes mutually needed by
one another; but because in woman this fact has led to
an excessive devotion which has cooled love, degraded
marriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should
be to itself or the other.... Woman, self-controlled,
would never be absorbed by any relations; it would be only
an experience to her as to man. It is a vulgar error that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>love, a love to woman, is her whole existence; she is also
born for truth and love in their universal energy.”—Margaret
Fuller Ossoli (“The Woman of the Nineteenth

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Professor Alfred Russell Wallace has written
an article, concerning part of which Mr. W. T. Stead
rightly says: “It is a scientific reinforcement of the cause
of the emancipation of women, and shows that progress
of the cause of female enfranchisement is identified with
the progress of humanity.”—(<cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, Vol. V.,
p. 177.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Wallace says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“When such social changes have been effected that no
woman will be compelled, either by hunger, isolation, or
social compulsion, to sell herself, whether in or out of wedlock,
and when all women alike shall feel the refining
influence of a true humanising education, of beautiful
and elevating surroundings, and of a public opinion which
shall be founded on the highest aspirations of their age and
country, the result will be a form of human selection which
will bring about a continuous advance in the average status
of the race. Under such conditions, all who are deformed
either in body or mind, though they may be able to lead
happy and contented lives, will, as a rule, leave no children
to inherit their deformity. Even now we find many women
who never marry because they have never found the man
of their ideal. When no woman will be compelled to marry
for a bare living or for a comfortable home, those who remain
unmarried from their own free choice will certainly
increase, while many others, having no inducement to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>an early marriage, will wait till they meet with a partner
who is really congenial to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In such a reformed society the vicious man, the man
of degraded taste or feeble intellect, will have little chance
of finding a wife, and his bad qualities will die out with
himself. The most perfect and beautiful in body and mind
will, on the other hand, be most sought, and, therefore, be
most likely to marry early, the less highly endowed later,
and the least gifted in any way the latest of all, and this will
be the case with both sexes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“From this varying age of marriage, as Mr. Galton has
shown, there will result a more rapid increase of the former
than of the latter, and this cause continuing at work for
successive generations will, at length, bring the average man
to be the equal of those who are now among the more advanced
of the race.”—“Human Progress, Past and Present”

<p class='c011'>“Science is of the utmost importance to mankind, but
the last degree of importance cannot be said to attach to
all its minute discoveries, and where, as in physiology, the investigation
becomes inhuman, there it ought to stop. It
ought to stop for our own sakes if from no other motive,
for the torturing of animals on the chance that it may
suggest the means of alleviating some of our own pains
helps to blunt those sensibilities which afford us some of
our purest pleasures. Animals are not our equals in all
things, but they seem to be at any rate our equals in the
sense of pain. The want of imagination may deprive it in
their case of some of its poignancy, but on the other hand
they have none of the supports which we derive from
reason and sympathy, from the tenderness of friendship and
the consolations of religion. With them it is pure, unmitigated,
unsolaced suffering. Our duties to them form a
neglected chapter in the code of ethics, but we ought not to
torture them, and there are many who will maintain that
the obligation is absolute. Life is no doubt valuable, but
it is not everything. It is more than meat, as the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>is more than raiment, but it is not more than humanity.
There are occasions on which it has to be risked, and there
are terms on which men of honour and patriotism would
hold it worthless. The doctrine that we may subject the
lower animals to incredible suffering on the possibility that
it may save ourselves from an additional pang is of a selfish
and degrading tendency. It helps to lower the ‘moral
ideal’ and to weaken the springs of heroism in human
character. We owe it to ourselves to keep clear of this
peril. Nature surrounds us with limitations. Here is one
which all that is best and noblest in us sets up, and it is
more sacred than those over which we have no control.
We refuse to torture other sentient creatures in order that
we may live.”—Dr. Henry Dunckley (<cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>,

<p class='c011'>The above noble pronouncement, with its conclusion, is
instinct with the spirit of <em>true</em> science (which repudiates
with disdain and horror the hypocritical pseudo-science of a
ghastly and demoralising study and pursuit of cruelty),—the
<em>true</em> science which is one with love, because it refuses the
acceptance of life itself on terms of outrage to love.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Observation is perhaps more powerful an organon than
either experiment or empiricism.”—Richard Jefferies
(“Story of My Heart,” p. 162).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... It is well that some English physicists of the
fullest scientific impulse and effort are revolted at the inhuman
and bootless cruelty of the foreign medical schools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>which masquerades as scientific research. Is it not possibly
something more than a coincidence that vivisectionists in
general exhibit an aversion to the equality of woman, and
that vivisection flourishes more unrestrainedly where her
position and influence are less recognised; <em>i.e.</em>, in plain
words,—in a lower civilisation?</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Lawson Tait says, with the indignation of a truly
scientific mind at these methods of “science falsely so
called”:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“For one, as intimately and widely concerned in the application
of human knowledge for the saving of human life and the
relief of human suffering as anyone can be, or as anyone has ever
been, I say I am grateful for the restrictive legislation. Let me
give one brief illustration of my most recent experience in this
matter as one of hundreds which confirm me in my determination
persistently to oppose the introduction into England of
what passes for science in Germany. Some few years ago I
began to deal with one of the most dreadful calamities to which
humanity is subject by means of an operation which had been
scientifically proposed nearly two hundred years ago. I mean
ectopic gestation. The <em>rationale</em> of the proposed operation was
fully explained about fifty years ago, but the whole physiology
of the normal process and the pathology of the perverted one
were obscured and misrepresented by a French physiologist’s
experiments on rabbits and dogs. Nothing was done, and at
least ninety-five per cent. of the victims of this catastrophe
were allowed to die.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I went outside the experimentalists’ conclusions, went back
to the true science of the old pathologist and of the surgeon of
1701, and performed the operation in scores of cases with
almost uniform success. My example was immediately followed
throughout the world, and during the last five or six years
hundreds if not thousands of women’s lives have been saved,
whilst for nearly forty years the simple road to this gigantic
success was closed by the folly of a vivisector....</p>

<p class='c004'>“Views such as mine are those of a minority of my professional
brethren, and are generally sneered at as those of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>crank. But my reply to this is that they form the new belief,
that of the coming generation, and that not one in fifty of the
bulk of my present brethren have ever seriously gone into the
question, and probably have never seen a single experiment on
a living animal.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My address as the Surgical Orator of 1890, when the
British Medical Association met in this town, was mainly
directed to the mischievous system of so-called scientific training,
of purely German origin and thoroughly repugnant to our
English tastes and our English common-sense.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is therefore a satisfactory matter to know that the Council
of Mason’s College would have none of it, and that the governing
body of the new University College of Nottingham has
recently decided similarly. The Medical School of Queen’s
College is now united entirely with the Science School of
Mason’s College; but we, of Mason’s College, have had the
direction of the science teaching of the Medical School for
several years, we have had no German scientific methods, and
our success has not diminished thereby one atom—on the
contrary.”—Lawson Tait, F.R.C.S., <em>President of Mason’s Science
College, Birmingham</em> (“The Discussion on Vivisection at the
Church Congress, October, 1892”).</p>

<p class='c011'>At the Congress, as above, Professor Horsley made
aspersions on Miss Frances Power Cobbe, as to statements
concerning Vivisection in her work, “The Nine Circles.”
The professor declared some of the reported cruel experiments
to have been painless, owing to the victims being
under the influence of anæsthetics. In reply to the attack,
the following preliminary letter from Miss Cobbe was then
published:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—Professor Horsley’s criticism on the above work—planned
and compiled by my direction—demands from me a
careful reply, which I shall endeavour to give as soon as may
be possible at this distance from the books whence the impugned
passages are derived. I shall be much surprised if the hocus
pocus of the sham anæsthetic <em>curare</em> with ineffective applications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of genuine chloroform do not once more illustrate ‘the
curse of vivisectible animals,’ and if the results of the experiments
in question, whatever were their worth, would not, in
most cases, have been vitiated had real and absolute anæsthesia
been produced in the victims. Should a small number of the
experiments cited in the ‘Nine Circles’ prove, however, to have
been performed on animals in an entirely painless state, I shall,
while withdrawing them with apologies from a forthcoming new
edition of the book, take care at the same time to call attention
to the multitude of other experiments, home and foreign, therein
recorded—e.g., baking to death, poisoning, starving, creating
all manner of diseases, inoculating in the eyes, dissecting out
and irritating the exposed nerves, causing the brain of cats ‘to
run like cream,’ etc., about which no room for doubt as to the
unassuaged agony of the animal can possibly exist.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Cobbe concludes by a sharp, but just, criticism on
her critic, and with an acute diagnosis of the learned vivisectionist’s
own condition:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The tone of Dr. Horsley’s remarks against me personally
will probably inspire those who know me and the history of my
connexion with the anti-vivisection cause with an amused sense
of the difficulty wherein the Professor must have found himself
when, instead of argument in defence of vivisection, he thus
turned to ‘abuse the plaintiffs’ attorney.’ For myself I gladly
accept such abuse (or mere bluster) as evidence that the consciences
even of eminent vivisectors are, like their victims’
nerves, imperfectly under the influence of the scientific
anæsthesia, and remain still sensitive to the heart-pricking
charge which I bring against them, of cowardly cruelty to
defenceless creatures.</p>

<p class='c011'>⁂ A further newspaper correspondence concerning
“The Nine Circles,” a work from which some of the foregoing
notes on vivisection are copied, has gone on while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Woman Free” is passing through the press; the vivisectors
saying that certain of the incidents transcribed in “The Nine
Circles” are without the announcement that in some cases
an anæsthetic had been administered prior to the act of
living anatomy, otherwise admittedly true in every detail.
The vivisectors lay what stress they can on the omissions;
indeed, their principal advocate has made use of a grossness
of imputation and a coarseness of invective that augurs ill
for any gentleness of treatment or purpose being existent in
the organism of such an operator.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, in truth, it is not a matter of surpassing import
whether the assertion of the operation (alone) being conducted
under an anæsthetic be indubitable, since the after-consequences
of pain or incommodity had to be endured
by the victim without anæsthetics. What initial chloroforming
could ward off the constant after-suffering attendant on
the incubation of the disease for the creation of which the
“operation” had been performed, a period acknowledgedly
often lasting for weeks, and terminated only by death’s
mercy? Or what medicament could anæsthetise the impotent
yearning—to feed her starving puppy—of a poor
mother dog whose mammary glands had been excised, even
if the “operation” had been carried out “under chloroform”?
Mr. Edward Berdoe, M.R.C.S., reproduces and
reprobates the incident with horror in the <cite>Times</cite> of Oct. 27,
1892:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Professor Goltz amputated the breast of the mother of a
puppy nursing her young&#160;... who ‘unceasingly licked the
living puppy with the same tenderness as an uninjured dog
might do.’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Most gladly may we turn to the words and ways of worthier
seekers after truth. Professor Lawson Tait is reported by
the <cite>Standard</cite>, 28th Oct., 1892, as saying at a meeting the
previous day:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“Vivisection was a survival from mediæval times. It could
not be justified by any results that it had produced. In days
when they could tell the composition of the atmosphere of Orion
by means of the spectroscope, it was a disgrace that men should
resort to vivisection, instead of perfecting other and more
humane means of research.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There speaks true science. And, on a later occasion,
Mr. Lawson Tait quotes the celebrated anatomist, Sir
Charles Bell (who had been falsely claimed as an advocate
of vivisection), as saying, “on page 217 of the second
volume of his great work on the Nervous System, published
in 1839”:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“... a survey of what has been attempted of late years
in physiology will prove that the opening of living animals has
done more to perpetuate error than to confirm the just views
taken from the study of anatomy and natural motions....
For my own part I cannot believe that Providence should
intend that the secrets of nature are to be discovered by means
of cruelty, and I am sure that those who are guilty of protracted
cruelties do not possess minds capable of appreciating the laws
of nature.”—(The <cite>Times</cite>, Nov. 8th, 1892, p. 3.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The views of Charles Bell and Lawson Tait are in striking
and encouraging coincidence with verses LIII., LIV., and
LV.</p>

<p class='c011'>To women peculiarly it belongs to oppose the doctrines
and methods of vivisectionists, for to the practitioners of
that school were due the arguments or assumptions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>sufficed to introduce for a while into our country the vile
system of according a licence to male dissoluteness and
female subjection—under a pretext of public morality and
“scientific” sanction—known on the continent as the
“police des mœurs,” and in sundry Naval and Military
stations of England and Ireland as the “Contagious

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The male conceit and jealousy of sex, existent among
the majority of meaner men, has been perceived and
censured or satirised by higher masculine minds both in
ancient and modern literature. To take a few scattered
instances from the latter, Shakespeare says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... however we do praise ourselves,</div>

      <div class='line'>More longing, wavering, sooner lost and won</div>
      <div class='line'>Than women’s are.”</div>
      <div class='line in10'>—(“Twelfth Night,” Act II., Sc. 4.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Goethe says pungently (in “Wilhelm Meister’s Apprenticeship”):
“People ridicule learned women and dislike even
women who are well informed, probably because it is considered
impolite to put so many ignorant men to shame.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As our own plain-spoken Sydney Smith has said, in his
essay on Female Education:—“It is natural that men who
are ignorant themselves, should view, with some degree of
jealousy and alarm, any proposal for improving the education
of women.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A ludicrously pitiful modern-day instance of the jealous
ignorance or ignorant jealousy to which Goethe and Sydney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Smith make reference, is afforded by a seriously-written
leading article in No. 545 of the <cite>Christian Commonwealth</cite>,
a London weekly newspaper, under date of 24th March,
1892:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The Woman question will not down. She is asserting herself
in every direction, and generally with considerable force.
In America she is positively alarming the lords of creation by
her rapid progress in educational matters. She is actually outrunning
the men in the race for intellectual attainments. And
this fact is becoming so evident, and so prominent, that a new
problem is being evolved from it. This is, how are the finely
educated young women of America to find congenial husbands?
It is assumed by some writers that already there is a great disparity
between the culture of the young men and young women,
and that every year the chasm between them is becoming
deeper and wider. This is a truly lamentable state of things,
but the woman movement in this country is likely to take a
more practical course. The agitation of the question of
Woman Suffrage may bring about a reaction against her excessive
culture. If woman is permitted to enter the cesspool of
politics, it is probable she will not be very long distressed with
an overplus of those qualities which are just now endangering
her conjugal felicity in the United States....”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is refreshing and consolatory to revert from such
verbiage to what Sir Humphrey Davy said (“Lectures, 1810
and 1811”): “It has been too much the custom to endeavour
to attach ridicule to the literary and scientific
acquisitions of women. Let <em>them</em> make it disgraceful for
men to be ignorant, and ignorance will perish.”</p>

of French intellect:—</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>girl is less different from that of the average boy, than the

education possesses the most brilliant and fertile
qualities, with which to secure the happiness of her husband
and herself.”—(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Physiologie du Mariage,” Méditation
XI.</span>).</p>

<p class='c011'>But the instances are innumerable where the intellect of
higher men expressly or unconsciously rebukes the jealous
sexual conceit of their less intelligent brethren. Dr.
Bonavia says, very tersely:—“The fact is, many men don’t
like the idea of being surpassed or even equalled by women.
They stupidly feel their dignity wounded. This jealousy,
however, is not only extremely contemptible and unjust,
but disastrous to the true interests of the race, for men have
mothers <em>as well as women</em>, and imbecility—the result of
atrophied frontal lobes—is just as likely to be transmitted
to the one sex as to the other, as far as we yet know.
Just see the injustice of men’s jealousy in matters of intellect.
Only recently the talent of Miss Ormerod—an
entomologist who can hold her own <em>anywhere</em> on earth—was
kept under by the Royal Agricultural Society. <em>She</em> did
the entomological work, and made the discoveries, while
<em>they</em> took the credit. In their reports they did not even
mention <em>her</em> name in connection with her own work!—A
more contemptible proceeding, it would appear, has never
been brought to light, in the struggle of the sexes, if that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>case has been correctly reported.”—(“Woman’s Frontal
Lobes.”)</p>

<p class='c011'>Bebel treats this jealousy with a fine irony in his exposition
of “the motives which induce most medical
professors, and indeed the professors of every faculty, to
oppose women students:”—“They regard the admission of
women as synonymous with the degradation of science (!)
which could not but lose its prestige in the eyes of the enlightened (!)
multitude if it appeared that the female brain
was capable of grasping problems which had hitherto only
been revealed to the elect of the opposite sex.”—(<em>Op.
cit.</em>, p. 132.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Had Bebel recorded masculine mercenary considerations,
rather than sham misgivings as to the interests of science,
his sarcasm would have been very grim truth. Indeed,
what is sometimes called the “loaves and fishes” argument
is at the root of most of this masculine jealousy which
cloaks itself under a pretension of tender consideration for
woman’s delicacy. To cite Bebel again: “Another objection
is that it is unseemly to admit women to medical
lectures, to operations, and deliveries, side by side with
male students. If men see nothing indecent in studying
and examining female patients in the presence of nurses
and other female patients, it is difficult to understand why
it should become so through the presence of female
students.”—(<em>Op. cit.</em>, p. 132.) And as to the actual
fitness of women for exercising the profession of medicine
or surgery:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Women always improve when the men begin to show
signs of failing,’ were the words of a distinguished physician
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>and surgeon, who had seen years of service on a remote
wintry station of the army. ‘I have had fellows brought
to me to have the leg amputated—perhaps both—close to
the body, and never anywhere in Paris, London, or New
York, saw I better surgeon’s assistants than some of our
women made, especially the Sisters of Charity, of whom we
had a few at the post, for three or four years. Heads as
clear as a silver bell; hands steady and unshrinking as
a granite rock, yet with a touch as light as a spring leaf;
foot quick and indefatigable, whether the time was noonday
or midnight; memory perfect; tenderness for the
sufferer unfailing. Talk about love, courage, fortitude, and
endurance in your sex! I tell you,’ he added, with a needless
affirmation at this point, ‘they seem to be nothing else,
when these are most wanted, and the man who doubts them
is an ass.’”—Eliza W. Farnham (“Woman and Her Era,”
Vol. II., p. 157). See also Note XXIX., 8.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>&#160;... Here may fittingly follow the report of a
trained masculine judgment as to woman’s ability in yet a
further profession—that of the law:—</p>

<p class='c011'>At the recent opening of the Southern California College
of Law, at Los Angeles, John W. Mitchell, the president,
in his lecture upon “The Study of the Law,” spoke of the
utility of women studying law, in the following language:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“This part of this discourse it is believed would be radically
incomplete without calling attention to one other and particular
class of persons who need an insight into the rudiments of law—which
class, it seems, has also been neglected by those
occupying a like position to my own—I mean the women. He
is, indeed, blind to the signs of the times who does not recognise
the expanding field of women’s work, and their increased
influence in the professions as well as in the fine arts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>That women are entering the lists with men, in behalf of themselves
and womankind, is well; for they must make up their
minds to take up the task of urging the reforms they need,
and must solve the woman problem in all its bearings. Women
are doing this. They are becoming competitors with men in
the pursuits of life, it is true; but it is as much from necessity
as choice. But it is not only the women who have to labour
and earn their own living who need legal knowledge to aid
them. It is more needful to the woman of property, be her
possessions but an humble home or a colossal fortune; whether
she be married or single. Women want this experience to
make them cautious of jeopardising their rights, and less confiding
in business matters. The courts are full of cases showing
how women have been wrongly stripped of their belongings.
And, perhaps, if one woman had known the legal effect of some
of her acts, one of the largest fortunes ever amassed in this
State of Crœsus-like wealth would not have been carried to
distant States, and there scandalously distributed amongst
scheming adventurers and lawyers, making a little Massachusetts
county-seat the theatre of one of the most remarkable
contests for a fortune in the whole annals of probate court law.</p>

<p class='c004'>“As to the professions: women were for a long time barred
from them, but now the barriers to all of them have been removed,
and there is not a profession in which women are not distinguished.
They have graduated in the sciences from most
universities with the highest honours, and have stood the same
tests as the men. The law was about the last to admit them
within its precincts, and there they are meeting with an unexpected
measure of success. Not only in this, but in other
countries, there are successful women practitioners. And in
France, where the preparatory course is most arduous, and the
term of study longest, a woman recently took the highest rank
over 500 men in her graduating examinations, and during the
whole six years of class study she only lost one day from her
work—an example that is commended to you students. Undoubtedly,
the weight of the argument is in favour of women
studying law.”—(<cite>Women’s Journal</cite>, Boston, U.S., 6th February,
1892.)</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Id.</em>... Even the vaunted politeness and gallantry
of the Frenchman is not proof against the far more deeply-bedded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>masculine jealousy. M. de Blowitz, the erudite
correspondent at Paris of the <cite>Times</cite>, reports that—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The law students yesterday hooted down Mdlle. Jeanne
Chauvin, 28 years of age, who was to have argued a thesis for
a legal degree. She had chosen as her theme, ‘The Professions
accessible to Women and the Historical Evolution of
the Economic Position of Woman in Society.’ The uproar was
such that the examiner postponed the ceremony <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</span></i>.
Mdlle. Chauvin is the first Frenchwoman who has sought a legal
degree, but two years ago a Roumanian lady went through the
ordeal without obstruction.”—(The <cite>Times</cite>, July 4, 1892.)</p>

<p class='c011'>To revert to the “loaves and fishes” argument, an incident
now to be given will show that medicine and the law
are not the only professions in which the objections to the
equal status of the sexes are largely prompted by a
“jalousie de métier” of a selfish and mercenary character:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The following letters have been received at Auckland

itself will be preserved in the Registry of the University. Immediate
action on this question by the Council of the Senate—the
body, with which, as you are aware, all legislation in the
University must begin—is not probable. The question was
raised about three years ago; and it became at once plain that,
if persevered in, it would produce a very serious division in the
ranks of those members of the University who had all shown
themselves, in the past, friends to the highest education of
women. Many of those who had earnestly supported the admission
of women to Tripos examinations, <em>would not support their
admission to the B.A. degree</em>. Into their—mostly practical—reasons
I cannot fully enter: One was the belief that admission to B.A.
must lead, in the end (in spite of any provisions which might be
introduced), to admission to M.A., and consequently to <em>a share
in the management of the University</em>; it was also apprehended that
difficulties would arise in the several colleges <em>with respect to
fellowships</em>, <em>etc.</em> I do not mention these difficulties as insuperable.
But they are felt by so many that there is, I am persuaded, no
prospect of successful action in this matter at the present time.
I shall, therefore, not myself propose anything in the Council,
nor so far has any other of the friends of women’s education, of
whom there are many on the Council, given notice of any
motion. At any future time, when such a motion is made, your
most influential memorial will certainly have its due weight
with the members of the Council, and if they decide to take
action, I hope also, with members of the Senate.</p>

It is often a mass of structural potentialities rather than of

those concerned with best-established instinctive operations,
naturally go on to their full development without the aid
of extrinsic stimuli; others, however, and large tracts of
these, seem to progress to such developments only under
the influence of suitable stimuli. Hence natural aptitudes
and potencies of the most subtle order may never be manifested
by multitudes of persons, for want of the proper
stimuli and practice capable of perfecting the development
and functional activity of those regions of the brain whose
action is inseparably related to the mental phenomena in

<p class='c011'>On women of medical education especially is the duty
incumbent to investigate the world of biological experience
in woman. They may not sit quietly down and assume
that in learning all that man has to teach, they rest his
equals, and that the last word has been said on the matter.
They have a field of exploration, with opportunities, with
implements, and with capacities, which man cannot have.
His research on such a question as the recognisedly most
vital one of human embryology with all its issues, can get but
rare and uncertain light from accidental occasions, and is,
moreover, simply as it were a dead anatomising; nor can he
by any means reach the psychic or introspective phase of
enquiry; but woman has the live subject, body and soul, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>her own organism, to study at her leisure. Does she not
yet see how to grasp such further living knowledge? But
that is the very quest here indicated. The askidian also
had no strength of vision, yet we can now tell and test the
light and the components of distant spheres.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are, undoubtedly, what may be termed intelligent
operations carried on in the body unconsciously to oneself,
or at any rate beyond the present ken of one’s actively perceptive
and volitional faculties. Observation and recognition
of these is to be striven for, and even guidance or
command of them may be ours in a worthy future. The
<cite>Times</cite> of 27th January, 1892, reported a lecture at the
Royal Institution on the previous day by Professor Victor
Horsley, in the course of which the lecturer—</p>

<p class='c004'>“... pointed out the pineal gland, which Descartes
thought to be the seat of the soul, but which was now known
to be an invertebrate eye. He also explained the functions of
certain small masses of grey matter, which are two, viz.—sight
and equilibration. The optic nerve was situated close to the
crura, and equilibration was subserved by the cerebellum. After
referring to the basal ganglia, Professor Horsley admitted that
as science advanced we seem to know less and less about the
specific functions of the various masses of grey matter, and less
definite views than formerly prevailed were now held with
respect to the local source of what are termed voluntary impulses,
and that of sensations.... We were still in
ignorance as to the functions of the optic thalamus, and of the
corpus striatum. Those of the cortex had to some extent been
ascertained. They might be divided into three classes, viz.—movement,
sensation, and what was termed mental phenomena.
But we were still in the dark as to those portions of the brain
which subserved intellectual operations, memory, and emotional
impulses. A like ignorance prevailed with respect to the basal
ganglia.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As yet we are in the infancy of our knowledge. What
we have done is but a speck compared to what remains to
be done. For what is there that we really know? We are
too apt to speak as if we had penetrated into the sanctuary
of truth and raised the veil of the goddess, when, in fact,
we are still standing, coward-like, trembling before the
vestibule, and not daring, from very fear, to cross the
threshold of the temple. The highest of our so-called laws
of nature are as yet purely empirical.</p>

<p class='c011'>“... They who discourse to you of the laws of nature
as if those laws were binding upon nature, or as if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>formed a part of nature, deceive both you and themselves.
The (so-called) laws of nature have their sole seat, origin,
and function in the human mind. They are simply the
conditions under which the regularity of nature is recognised.
They explain the external world, but they reside in the internal.
As yet we know scarcely anything of the laws of
mind, and, therefore, we scarcely know anything of the laws
of nature. We talk of the law of gravitation, and yet we
know not what gravitation is; we talk of the conservation
of force and distribution of forces, and we know not what
forces are; we talk with complacent ignorance of the
atomic arrangements of matter, and we neither know what
atoms are nor what matter is; we do not even know if
matter, in the ordinary sense of the word, can be said to
exist; we have as yet only broken the first ground, we have
but touched the crust and surface of things. Before us and
around us there is an immense and untrodden field, whose
limits the eye vainly strives to define; so completely are they
lost in the dim and shadowy outline of the future. In that
field, which we and our posterity have yet to traverse, I
firmly believe that the imagination will effect quite as much
as the understanding. Our poetry will have to reinforce
our logic, and we must feel as much as we argue. Let us
then hope, that the imaginative and emotional minds of one
sex will continue to accelerate the great progress, by acting
upon and improving the colder and harder minds of the
other sex.”—Buckle (“Influence of Women on the Progress
of Knowledge”).</p>

within the depths of their own consciousness, can fully
comprehend all that is meant in the words a ‘Purposed
Maternity.’ I use them in their highest sense, meaning not
the mere purpose of satisfying the maternal instincts, which
the quadruped feels and acts from, as well as the human
being, but the intelligent, artistic purpose (to which the
maternal instinct is a fundamental motive), to act in harmony
with Nature in producing the most perfect being which the
powers and resources employed, can bring forth....
It is probable that we shall, ere long, arrive at truer
views of maternity everywhere; and when we do, I think it
will be seen that the office has a sacredness in Nature’s eyes
above all other offices, and that she reserves for it the finest
of her vital forces, powers, susceptibilities, and means of
every sort.”—Eliza W. Farnham (“Woman and Her Era,”

beneficial beyond expectation. The health of women
generally is improving under the change; there is amongst
women generally less bloodlessness, less of what the old
fiction-writers called swooning; less of lassitude, less of
nervousness, less of hysteria, and much less of that general
debility to which, for want of a better term, the words
‘<em>malaise</em>’ and ‘languor’ have been applied. Woman, in
a word, is stronger than she was in olden time. With
this increase of strength woman has gained in development
of body and of limb. She has become less distortioned.
The curved back, the pigeon-shaped chest, the disproportioned
limb, the narrow feeble trunk, the small and
often distorted eyeball, the myopic eye, and puny ill-shaped
external ear—all these parts are becoming of better and
more natural <em>contour</em>. The muscles are also becoming
more equally and more fully developed, and with these
improvements, there are growing up amongst women

</div>

<p class='c019'>What, then, is the result of these investigations?</p>

<p class='c011'>Briefly this:</p>

<p class='c011'>That woman is not incapable of equal mental and physical
power with man:</p>

<p class='c011'>That where any inferiority on her part at present exists,
it is but as the inherited result of long ages of misuse of
her functions, and of want of training of her faculties:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>That an intelligent education in both directions can repair
these wrongs, and establish her due individuality, and her
equal share in human right and happiness:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That the principle which regulates the existing social
relations between the two sexes—the legal subordination of
one sex to the other—is wrong in itself and now one of the
chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought
to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality, admitting
no power or privilege on the one side, nor disability on the
other”—(<span class='sc'>John Stuart Mill</span>, “The Subjection of Women,”
Ch. I.):</p>

<p class='c011'>And that, as the result of woman’s amended position,
the whole human race will benefit physically and psychically.</p>

<p class='c019'>Thus much, at least, may be fairly concluded from the
“Notes” here presented; in the gathering together of
which scattered rays—thoughts and experiences from many
an observant mind—into one focus, to offer light and

<p class='c004'>[By the law of England a
girl is still marriageable at
twelve and a boy at fourteen
years of age; though the
“age of consent” to intercourse
not thus sanctioned
has been recently raised to
sixteen years in the case of
girls. In the above matters,
and notably in that of the
marriageable age, England
remains barbarously below
most modern legislatures,
and is indeed in the disgraceful
condition of being
not even on a level with
China, in which country—as
Mr. Byrant Barrett points
out, in his Introductory Discourse
to the “Code Napoléon,”
p. 66—“In females, it
would appear, consummation
is not allowable before
twelve,” while “the age for
marriage in males is twenty
complete.” China and England
are but slightly in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>advance of ancient India,
where, according to the precepts
of Manu, as Mr. Barrett
further shows, (p. 30),
“The male of 24 years
should marry the girl of 8
years of age; the male of 30
the female of 12” (Ordinances
of Manu, ch. 9, sec.
94). Is not such conduct as
this sufficient to involve as
inevitable consequences “unripe
maternity and untimely
birth,” together with all their
dire inherited miseries?]</p>

<p class='c004'>“But I hear you indignantly
reject the boon of
equality with such creatures
as men now are. With you
I would equally elevate both
sexes. Really enlightened
women, disdaining equally
the submissive tricks of the
slave and the caprices of the
despot, breathing freely only
in the air of the esteem
of equals, and of mutual,
unbought, uncommanded,
affection, would find it difficult
to meet with associates
worthy of them in men as
now formed, full of ignorance
and vanity, priding themselves
on a <em>sexual</em> superiority,
entirely independent of
any merit, any superior
qualities, or pretentions to
them, claiming respect from
the strength of their arm,
and the lordly faculty of
producing beards attached
by nature to their chins!
No: unworthy of, as incapable
of appreciating, the
delight of the society of
such women, are the great
majority of the existing race
of men. The pleasures of
mere animal appetite, the
pleasures of commanding
(the prettier and more helpless
the slave, the greater
these pleasures of the brute),
are the only pleasures which
the majority of men seek
from women, are the only
pleasures which their education
and the hypocritical
system of morals, with which
they have been necessarily
imbued, permit them to expect....
To wish for
the enjoyment of the higher
pleasures of sympathy and
communication of knowledge
between the sexes,
heightened by that mutual
grace and glow, that decorum
and mutual respect,
to which the feeling of perfect,
unrestrained equality
in the intercourse gives
birth, a man must have
heard of such pleasures,
must be able to conceive
them, and must have an
organisation from nature or
education, or both, capable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>of receiving delight from
them when presented to
him. To enjoy these pleasures,
to which their other
pleasures, a few excepted,
are but the play of children
or brutes, the bulk of men
want a sixth sense; they
want the capacity of feeling
them, and of believing that
such things are in nature to
be found. A mole cannot
enjoy the “beauties and
glories” of the visible world;
nor can brute men enjoy
the intellectual and sympathetic
pleasures of equal
intercourse with women,
such as some are, such as
all might be. Real and
comprehensive knowledge,
physical and moral, equally
and impartially given by
education, and by all other
means to both sexes, is the
key to such higher enjoyments....</p>

an equal chance of happiness
with men, from the
development and exercise
of your faculties.”</p>

<p class='c004'>[The impotent and contradictory
schemes of ethics
which philosophers or
schoolmen, ancient and
modern, have successively
evolved, have been but resultants
of “unisexual wit.”
With brilliant exceptions in
Plato, Kant, and Mill, vainly
may the various codes be
searched for any suggestion
of the identity, individuality,
and equality, of woman.
For though the philosophy
of latter-day ethicists rightly
disdains to reiterate or to
countenance the factitious
scriptural dogmas and imprecations
declaratory or
explanatory of woman’s unequal
and subjugated condition,
yet a parallel subjection
and inferiority in her nature
is still tacitly assumed, and
on occasion traded upon,
by these same ethicists; no
counsel or consent of her
own intelligence being
asked, or disavowal recked
of, in such propositions as,
<em>e.g.</em>, the “utilitarian” theses
concerning her enounced by
Archdeacon Paley or Mr.
Jeremy Bentham;—the
nominally “goddess,” but
virtually “slave,” status assigned
to her by M. Auguste
Comte;—or the “due”
amount of child-bearing postulated
as prior to all
“normally feminine mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>energy” in her, by Mr.
Herbert Spencer. As the
bane of all theologies has
been the implicated degradation
and subserviency of
womanhood to the unjustly
favoured male sex, so the
vital defect in the plans of
ethics is this irrational disregard
for the personality
and interests of “one half
the human race,”—this
ignoring or negation of
woman’s equal claim with
man to consideration, position,
and action, in all that
relates to humanity, ethics
included. At present the
general masculine sex-bias,
or selfishness, refuses to
women the wisest and noblest
a faculty in legislation conceded
to even the meanest
men; and justice and injustice,
pessimism and optimism,
struggle together
blindly and helplessly in the
dark. The true Ethic still
awaits for its formulation
the assistance and the inspiration
of the intellect of
woman equal and free: no
other way can it be arrived
at.]</p>

<p class='c004'>“One of those who fought
to the last on the rebels’
side was the Ranee, or
Princess, of Jhansi, whose
territory had been one of our
annexations. For months
after the fall of Delhi
she contrived to baffle Sir
Hugh Rose and the English.
She led squadrons in the
field. She fought with her
own hand. She was engaged
against us in the
battle for the possession of
Gwalior. In the uniform of
a cavalry officer she led
charge after charge, and
she was killed among those
who resisted to the last.
Her body was found upon
the field, scarred with
wounds enough in the front
to have done credit to any
hero. Sir Hugh Rose paid
her the well-deserved tribute
which a generous conqueror
is always glad to be able to
offer. He said, in his
general order, that ‘The
best man upon the side of
the enemy was the woman
found dead, the Ranee of
Jhansi.’”—Justin McCarthy
(“History of Our Own
Times,” chap. xiii).</p>

<p class='c004'>And on the 12th December,
1892, the <em>Manchester
Guardian</em> reports:—</p>

<p class='c004'>“The death is announced
of Mrs. Eliza E. Cutler, wife
of the doorkeeper of the
United States Senate. In
February, 1863, her husband’s
regiment was at Fort
Donelson and Mrs. Cutler
was visiting him there, stopping
at a house just outside
the fortification. The
colours of the regiment were
also in this house. In the
excitement which followed
the first attack on the day
of battle, the regiment went
into action without its flag,
but just as the fighting
became the hottest, with
odds terribly against them,
they were cheered by the
appearance of a woman with
a sword in one hand, and
bearing triumphantly aloft
the regiment’s colours. This
was Mrs. Cutler, who remained
on the battlefield
until her husband’s regiment
was ordered on board a
transport in the Cumberland
river. She immediately
went to the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>deck, where, with assistance,
she planted the Stars and
Stripes in the face of a
galling fire. There she remained,
in spite of all
remonstrances, until they
passed out of the range of
fire.”</p>

that human life is on the

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
